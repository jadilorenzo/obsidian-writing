Aaron Jackson was funny. 
Once when we were at Campbell University and Aaron Jackson was conducting the 300-member youth choir, Aaron Jackson began the choir practice with the joke: "If it ain't Baroque, don't fix it." 
His most memorable use of humor was on one regular Wednesday evening choir practice with the adult choir. I don't remember what mistake the choir made, but I know it was egregious because, upon hearing their singing, he dropped his music binder and rolled around on the white, speckled linoleum floor â€” as if in agony from hearing such a painful disharmony.
In addition, to this day, Aaron Jackson is the only person to invent a nickname for my name: Jacob. The youth choir was singing one song that involved singing the word "Hallelujah." To Aaron Jackson's dismay, we were singing that word "Hallelu - yuh" as in "yummy." He instructed us to sing it like "Hallelu - yaw" like a German saying "Ya, man" or, even better, like my name: "Yah - cob."
More than the words he spoke, Aaron Jackson expressed humor facial expressions, in his eyes.
