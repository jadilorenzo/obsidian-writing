It might come as a surprise to you, but I used to be able to sing — like really high.

There I was. Singing in front of a crowd while in a crowd, a choir namely, is one thing. Singing a solo is quite another.

I was 14 when I sang my first solo... in front of 2,000+ crowd.

Aaron Jackson was funny. Once when we were at Campbell University and Aaron Jackson was conducting the 300-member youth choir, Aaron Jackson began the choir practice with a joke: "If it ain't Baroque, don't fix it."  On one Wednesday, our youth choir was singing a song that involved singing the word "Hallelujah." To Aaron Jackson's dismay, we were singing the end of the word "Hallelu - yuh" like the word "yummy." He instructed us to sing it like "Hallelu - yaw" like a German saying "Yah, man" or, even better, like my name: "Yah - cob." That was my nickname at choir from that point on. Even more than what he said, Aaron Jackson expressed humor through his facial expressions and the brightness of his eyes — or as he described it when describing the choir's proper facial expression: "From your nose down, your face should look like an opera singer; from your nose up, you should have the excitement of a first-grade teacher." His eyes always shone with first-grade-teacher-level excitement. Even when someone was being difficult, his eyes still shone — maybe even brighter. Aaron Jackson's most memorable use of humor was on one regular Wednesday evening choir practice with the adult choir. I don't remember what mistake the choir made. Still, I know it was egregious because, upon hearing their singing, Aaron Jackson dropped his music binder and rolled around on the white, speckled linoleum floor — in agony from hearing such painful disharmony. Even when correcting the choir, Aaron Jackson made people laugh.

Aaron Jackson had energy. Every single week, Aaron Jackson introduced the songs with zest. Initially, I thought, "If he's this energetic now, he must be more relaxed later." It's like seeing a falling star that never actually fades; a comet that keeps orbiting the planet with the same burning brightness forever. Aaron Jackson was ALWAYS that energized. He was energized straight through hours and hours of practice with the Choir, Youth Choir, Chamber Choir, and Orchestra on Wednesday and Sunday. Sometimes, he would be so excited about a musical piece he would ask the choir to repeat a section just because he loved it. He made the choir sing the Hallelujah Chorus perfectly about three times consecutively because he loved it so much. And he wasn't the only one enjoying it: my younger brother and I got to sit in on the adult choir practice and pretend to be reading our books. Aaron Jackson exuded energy while conducting too. Whether for a concert or just Sunday service, he would literally bounce while conducting the time signature — even working up a sweat sometimes. He was energetic.

Aaron Jackson taught music with precision. For example, Aaron Jackson taught "tall vowels." A lot of choirs have "flat" vowels: where each choir member's drawl or slight accent compounds to a significant collective southern accent. This might turn "A mighty fortress is our God" into "I my dee fort dress is are God." As Aaron Jackson would remind us, "We're not a country town choir, you know." Having tall vowels involves changing flat vowels like "Aw" (like the sound your doctor tells you to make) into "Ah" like a British pronunciation of "Top" and opening the space behind your jaw like when you're yawning. Such vowels allow you to hear the resonance of your own singing. The final effect is a choir that has a deep and resounding sound that you can feel from the back seat of a large auditorium. One common tall vowel warmup was singing "ma, may, me, my, mow, mu" in unison, trying to maintain the resonance from vowel to vowel. Aaron Jackson also taught coordinated consonants. Take "immense and free," for instance; it might easily be sung, "Immensss an free" if consonants were disregarded. Instead, Aaron Jackson taught leaving the consonant off till the next word so "s"s don't fissile out or worse, certain consonants disappear altogether. For example, we would sing "Immense and free," like "Immen san dfree," which may not sound right solo but sounds great as a choir. 

Besides enunciation, Aaron Jackson taught musical self-evaluation. He would often ask the choir to identify their own mistakes like an alto volunteering "I think the altos were a little off-pitch." or a tenor saying "The bass section was too quiet" (because they always were.) One time, the youth choir (about 15 members) was singing on the Sunday after Easter when the tenors came in off-tune which made that song section sound weird. Instead of criticizing the error, Aaron Jackson later said with a smile, "Something went wrong. What do you think it was?" One of the students, incidentally the only tenor who could sing tenor, spoke up and said that he had sung the wrong note and led the tenor section to do the same. As soon as we analyzed the problem, there was nothing more to discuss. One incredible benefit of these analyses was that I learned an instinct for music. At the previous church, I had attempted improvised harmonization to common hymns, after my older brother who harmonized beautifully. But now, I could harmonize with any hymn I desired, despite my honking teenage voice. Aaron Jackson put his life into the quality of his music, and it paid off.

Aaron Jackson achieved remarkable results. First, he built a talented musical community. Take Karen Bullock for instance: she could be given any complicated piece of piano music she'd never seen and play it perfectly... immediately. Out of the hours and hours she spent accompanying choir practice and performing, I've only heard her make one single mistake. Then there's the Danchi family. All four of the kids played violin and viola professionally, and two of the sisters were always in the orchestra. Furthermore, so many people were drawn to Aaron Jackson and his music program, so there were more than enough people for a full choir and orchestra to perform weekly. Second, Aaron Jackson conducted beautiful concerts. He spent months selecting music for the annual Christmas concert. Sometimes only a month after the Christmas performance, Aaron Jackson would roll out his selection for the next year. But when this performance finally came, it was a big deal. The auditorium which could easily fit 1500 people was packed. Seats were lined against the wall, and they too were filled. I was thankful the youth choir had reserved seating; because we might have had to stand otherwise. But it was like he lived the music when Aaron Jackson stood on the conductor's podium (which would take him from about 5'8" to 6'2"). His face took on a heavenly visage and his eyes glowed with inner light. The music was deep, rich, resounding, pure, lovely. On that very stage, it was as if Aaron Jackson wielded the full power of music; music that melted hearts and touched souls.  Aaron Jackson's music was heavenly.

Beth Grose was passionate about teaching science. Every year she would play "The Periodic Table of Elements" song for the new batch of chemistry students. She would bob her head from side to side and sing along to "There's hydrogen and helium, then lithium, beryllium." She even had a song for Polyatomic Ions too. No one could accuse Mrs. Grose of being boring! When it came time for the chemiluminescence lab, Mrs. Grose didn't miss anything. She got blackout blinds for the windows. She moved all 25 students and 12 tables into one room. And as soon as the reactants were mixed and all lights went off, Mrs. Grose would call out the time intervals — one minute, two minutes, three — and we would all write whether the chemicals in the glass vial were brighter than the minute before. We even measured whose reaction shone the brightest. 
Even after class, Mrs. Grose would talk about science-related topics — sometimes at great length. For example, she spent thirty minutes talking about screen radiation, citing studies showing phone-shaped tumors, and showing off her radiation-proof phone purse. Beth Grose was passionate about science.

Sue Grey was passionate about public speaking. In her public speaking class, she demonstrated proper public speaking techniques with drama. She would interrupt her lecture, stand in front of some student's desk, lean over, and whisper something like, "Jacob... Do you know why a monotone is boring?" Suddenly, every student in the class was listening with rapt attention. She would then break loose of the sudden intensity and continue her fascinating monologue on the monotone. She changed the speed of her speech too. One moment she would be ferociously spitting out words like hailstones falling from the sky. The next, she would be letting her words fall with ponderous heaviness like a single drop from a leaking faucet in an abandoned house. Out of the students in her speech class, Mrs. Grey would often select students to join Mock Trial, a competitive form of speech and debate to which she devoted twenty years of volunteer work. Mock Trial is a full trial simulation, complete with affidavits, witnesses, evidence, a judge, a jury, and attorneys. The state championships would often take place in real courtrooms with real judges. Mrs. Grey led her teams with such excellence that several teams competed on a national level. Whenever it came time for the regional championship, everyone was excited — but none more than Mrs. Grey. She spoke faster than ever and her dramatic gestures became frenetic. But she had prepared her students well. My older sister Christiana, for instance, was so immersed in playing the role of Blake Spoulder, a forensic expert, and her argument became so real, that she started asking the attorney questions. The attorney (another student) had to catch herself so she didn't answer Christiana's questions and said "Wait a second... I thought I was supposed to be the one asking the questions." Aside from the skills shown and developed in the competitions themselves, several of Mrs. Grey's Mock Trial team members went on to become real attorneys and pass the bar exam. Sue Grey taught public speaking with excellence and passion.

Caleb Woods is passionate about optimizing. Caleb Woods is the owner and CEO of the RoleModel Software consulting company. Every Friday, RoleModel Software has what is called a Chow and Pow-Wow, where the company shares a meal (even over Zoom) and various members present on various topics — such as John Calvin Young's "The Case of The Uncreated Index" or Mark Kraemer's "The Science of Motivation." One of my favorite presentations was Caleb Woods's presentation on keyboard shortcuts. Developers love customization, but Mr. Woods was extra-passionate about keyboard shortcuts. He showed how almost all developer tools and websites had uniform navigation shortcuts, "H," "J," "K," and "L". He talked about using "^Tab" and "^Shift-Tab" for tab navigation. He even advocated using "⌘X" over "⌘C + Delete" because it saved a single keystroke. Above all, he encouraged using file switchers (⌘P) and command pallets (⌘Shift-P) instead of inefficiently moving your cursor all over the place. But Mr. Wood's passion for optimizing goes beyond shortcuts. One week, after giving a lecture on maximizing impact, Mr. Woods opened the discussion up to the whole company by asking "Where are we inefficient? Where are those little inefficiencies that can add up to lots of wasted time?" Several inefficiencies were considered — some of which Mr. Woods had already planned to amend. But what struck me was the humility: that Mr. Woods knew there were inefficiencies and that he knew he couldn't see all of them. Caleb Woods took optimizing to a whole new level.
