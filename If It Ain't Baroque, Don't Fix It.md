I sang my first solo to over 2,000 people at the "Let There Be Light" Christmas concert. Countless hours had been poured into crafting the concert, but no one was more essential to the project's success than the choir and orchestra director, Aaron Jackson. Only one thing was lacking in the whole arrangement, Aaron Jackson's face was toward the choir, not the audience. Aaron Jackson's eyes flowed with an intense energy that electrified the choir. If this energy had been condensed into a cup of coffee, it would have been enough to wake a paralytic. "Let There Be Light" indeed.

Aaron Jackson had a strong sense of humor. Once he opened up his Campbell University choir practice with one of his favorite one-liners: "If it ain't Baroque, don't fix it.” During one Wednesday night practice, our youth choir was singing a song that involved singing the word "Hallelujah." To Aaron Jackson's dismay, we were singing the end of the word "Hallelu - yuh" like the word "yummy." He instructed us to sing it like "Hallelu - yaw" like a German saying "Yah, man" or, even better, like my name: "Yah - cob" (“Jacob” with a twist.) Even more than what he said, Aaron Jackson expressed humor through his facial expressions and the brightness of his eyes — like how he described the choir’s proper expression: "From your nose down, your face should look like an opera singer; from your nose up, you should have the excitement of a first-grade teacher." Even when a choir member was difficult, his eyes shone — sometimes even brighter. On one Wednesday the youth choir made an egregious mistake, and upon hearing it, Aaron Jackson flung his music binder aside, flopped to the ground, and rolled around on the white, speckled linoleum floor — exclaiming, "Oh my stars..." in agony from hearing the painful disharmony.

Aaron Jackson had energy. He blazed through hours and hours of practice with the adult choir, youth choir, chamber choir, and orchestra on Wednesday and Sunday. Sometimes, he would be so excited about a musical piece he would ask the choir to repeat it for the sheer joy of it. In fact, he made the choir sing the Hallelujah Chorus perfectly three times consecutively. Aaron Jackson exuded energy while conducting too. Whether for a concert or Sunday church service, he would bounce while conducting the time signature — even working up a sweat. Aaron Jackson was where he wanted to be.

Aaron Jackson taught music with precision. For instance, he taught the choir to have "tall" vowels. Choirs often have "flat" vowels and, consequently, a collective southern accent. Such flat vowels might turn "A mighty fortress is our God" into "I my dee fort dress is are God." As Aaron Jackson would remind us, "We're not a country town choir, you know.” Tall vowels involve, instead of singing flat vowels like "Aw" as in the sound your doctor tells you to make, singing tall vowels like "Ah" as in the British pronunciation of "Top." It’s about opening the space behind your jaw like when you're yawning to gain greater resonance. Such resonance allows a listener to feel the vibration of the music, even from the back seat of an auditorium. A common tall vowel warmup we practiced was singing "ma, may, me, my, mow, mu" in unison, attempting to maintain the resonance from vowel to vowel. Aaron Jackson also taught coordinated consonants. Take "immense and free," for instance; it might easily be sung, "Immensss an free" _if_ consonants were disregarded. Instead, Aaron Jackson taught leaving the consonant off till the next word so "s"s don't fizzle out or worse, certain consonants disappear altogether. For example, we would sing "Immense and free," like "Immen san dfree," which may not sound great by itself but sounds great as a choir.

Besides enunciation, Aaron Jackson taught musical self-evaluation. He would often ask the choir to identify their mistakes like an alto volunteering "I think the altos were a little off-pitch" or a tenor saying "The bass section was too quiet" (because they always were.) One time, the youth choir (about 15 members) was singing on the Sunday after Easter when the tenors came in off-tune which made that song section sound weird. Instead of criticizing the error, Aaron Jackson later said with a smile, "Something went wrong. What do you think it was?" One of the students, incidentally the only tenor who could sing tenor, spoke up and said that he had sung the wrong note and led the tenor section to do the same. As soon as we analyzed the problem, there was nothing more to discuss. One incredible benefit of these analyses was that I learned an instinct for music. At the previous church, I had attempted improvised harmonization to common hymns, after my older brother who harmonized beautifully. But now, I could harmonize with any hymn I desired. Aaron Jackson put his life into the quality of his music, and it paid off.

Aaron Jackson achieved remarkable results. First, he built a talented musical community. Take Karen Bullock for instance: she could be given any complicated piece of sheet music she'd never seen before and play it perfectly... immediately. Out of the hours and hours she spent accompanying choir practice and performing, I've only heard her make one single mistake. Then there's the Danchi family. All four of the kids played violin and viola professionally, and two of the sisters were always in the orchestra. Furthermore, so many people were drawn to Aaron Jackson and his music program that there were more than enough people for a full choir and orchestra to perform weekly. Second, Aaron Jackson conducted beautiful concerts. He spent months selecting music for the annual Christmas concert. Sometimes only a month after the Christmas performance, Aaron Jackson would roll out his selection for the next year. But when this performance finally came, it was a big deal. The auditorium which could easily fit 1500 people was packed. Seats were lined against the wall, and they too were filled. I was thankful the youth choir had reserved seating; because we might have had to stand otherwise. But it was like he lived the music when Aaron Jackson stood on the conductor's podium (which would take him from about 5'8" to 6'2"). His face took on a heavenly visage and his eyes glowed with inner light. The music was deep, rich, resounding, pure, lovely. On that very stage, it was as if Aaron Jackson wielded the full power of music; music that melted hearts and touched souls. Aaron Jackson's music was heavenly.

But what struck me most about Aaron Jackson was his overwhelming joy. I had always been a happy kid, but that was because I didn't care. If I was ever disappointed, my ever-ready response was "Maybe tomorrow." But Aaron Jackson was happy because he did care. He cared so much about music that he dedicated his life to it. But how could someone be working and happy? I had no idea. But then I started noticing other people who had that same effervescent joy _and_ a passion for something beautiful.

Beth Grose was passionate about teaching science. Every year she would play "The Periodic Table of Elements" song for the new batch of chemistry students. She would bob her head from side to side and sing along to "There's hydrogen and helium, then lithium, beryllium." She even had a song for Polyatomic Ions too. No one could accuse Mrs. Grose of being boring! When it came time for the chemiluminescence lab, Mrs. Grose didn't miss anything. She got blackout blinds for the windows. She moved all 25 students and 12 tables into one room. And as soon as the reactants were mixed and all lights went off, Mrs. Grose would call out the time intervals — one minute, two minutes, three — and we would all write whether the chemicals in the glass vial were brighter than the minute before. We even measured whose reaction shone the brightest. Even after class, Mrs. Grose would talk about science-related topics — sometimes at great length. For example, she spent thirty minutes discussing screen radiation, citing studies showing phone-shaped tumors, and showing off her radiation-proof phone purse. Beth Grose was passionate about science.

Sue Gray was passionate about public speaking. In her public speaking class, she demonstrated proper public speaking techniques with drama. She would interrupt her lecture, stand in front of some student's desk, lean over, and whisper something like, “Jacob, do you know why a monotone is boring?" Suddenly, every student in the class was listening with rapt attention. She would then break loose of the sudden intensity and continue her fascinating monologue on the monotone. She changed the speed of her speech too. One moment she would be ferociously spitting out words like hailstones falling from the sky. The next, she would be letting her words fall with a ponderous heaviness like water droplets falling from a leaking faucet in an abandoned house. Out of the students in her speech class, Mrs. Gray would often select students to join Mock Trial, a competitive form of speech and debate to which she devoted twenty years of volunteer work. Mock Trial is a full trial simulation, complete with affidavits, witnesses, evidence, a judge, a jury, and attorneys. Furthermore, the state championships would often take place in real courtrooms with real judges. Mrs. Gray led her teams with such excellence that several teams competed on a national level. Whenever it came time for the regional championship, everyone was excited — but none more than Mrs. Gray. She spoke faster than ever and her dramatic gestures became frenetic. But she had prepared her students well. My older sister Christiana, for instance, was so immersed in playing the role of Blake Spoulder, a forensic expert, and her argument became so real, that she started asking the attorney questions. The attorney (another student) had to catch herself so she didn't answer Christiana's questions and said "Wait a second... I thought I was supposed to be the one asking the questions." Aside from the skills shown and developed in the competitions themselves, several of Mrs. Gray's Mock Trial team members went on to become real attorneys and pass the bar exam. Sue Gray taught public speaking with excellence and passion.

Caleb Woods is passionate about optimizing. Caleb Woods is the owner and CEO of the RoleModel Software consulting company. Every Friday, RoleModel Software has what is called a Chow and Pow-Wow, where the company shares a meal (even over Zoom) and various members present on various topics — such as John Calvin Young's "The Case of The Uncreated Index" or Mark Kraemer's "The Science of Motivation." One of my favorite presentations was Caleb Woods's presentation on keyboard shortcuts. Developers love customization, but Mr. Woods was extra-passionate about keyboard shortcuts. He showed how almost all developer tools and websites had uniform navigation shortcuts: "H," "J," "K," and "L". He talked about using "^Tab" and "^Shift-Tab" for tab navigation. He even advocated using "⌘X" over "⌘C + Delete" because it saved a single keystroke. Above all, he encouraged using file switchers (⌘P) and command pallets (⌘Shift-P) instead of inefficiently moving your cursor all over the place. But Mr. Wood's passion for optimizing goes beyond shortcuts. One week, after giving a lecture on maximizing impact, Mr. Woods opened the discussion up to the whole company by asking "Where are we inefficient? Where are those little inefficiencies that can add up to lots of wasted time?" Several inefficiencies were considered — some of which Mr. Woods had already planned to amend. But what struck me was the humility: Mr. Woods knew there were inefficiencies, and he knew he couldn't see all of them. Caleb Woods took optimizing to a whole new level.

Aaron Jackson rolled around on the floor. Beth Grose sang silly chemistry songs. Sue Gray whispered rhetorical questions. Caleb Woods advocated for shortcutting single keystrokes. These actions and passions they represent may seem silly and unrelatable. Although, I don't understand why some people like country, the joy is still real. But unlike entertainment where the show ends, the curtains close, and the credits scroll past, a true passion for teaching, performing, optimizing, or creating lasts. I've certainly felt it before. Sometimes when I'm playing piano or writing code, I feel the same inner fire. My younger brother can assure you: I can't comprehend anything beyond the piano when I'm playing — even if he's been trying to get my attention for several minutes. You've probably felt this joy before. Perhaps you felt it writing that essay about Shakespeare. Maybe it was that time you cooked those steaks to perfection. Maybe it was that time you fixed the lawn mower's carburetor. I never saw those times as opportunities. Work made me feel uncomfortable so I avoided it — in every form. But when I felt that passion, like that one Christmas when I couldn't stop playing "I Heard the Bells," I overlooked the joy and satisfaction that lay at my fingertips. I thought all work had to be endured... to eventually get around to the fun. I didn't know the joy that comes from great work. Do you?

Now instead of avoiding my work, I’m searching for work about which I can be passionate. Life is filled with toil, but for a rare few, their work brings joy. Beyond bringing delight to themselves, passionate people frequently bring purpose and fulfillment to their community.




Caleb Woods, CEO of RoleModel Software, is passionate about helping people grow in "Character, Collaboration, and Craftsmanship" — the company motto. Every January, Mr. Woods selects the applicants for the "Craftsmanship Academy." (Becoming a "craftsman" is the RoleModel equivalent of becoming a senior developer.) The Academy typically takes college graduates and trains them in the "RoleModel Way" of programming. The Academy builds careers: taking a person from novice to craftsman in 7 to 10 years, and most employees stay longer than that. Many have worked at RoleModel since it was founded in 1997. Mr. Woods not only selects the upcoming "academites" (as we call them) but also runs the academy, teaching most of the lessons. At the end of the Academy, the academites present their fully-functional online go-fish game **at** the weekly "Chow and Pow-Wow" where the local offices (in NC and WI) eat together (chow) and people give PowerPoint **presentations** (pow-wow). A lot of the talks are technical, but many of Mr. Wood's presentations, when not monetary reviews, are about interpersonal skills like leadership, teamwork, and good listening. And Mr. Woods listens well. In fact, during a recent chow, he asked everyone what "small, persistent issues have been costing time." One person mentioned intermittent test failures and another mentioned the need for better documentation. Caleb Woods wrote them down and explained how he had come up with a plan to improve documentation over the next CCC days. CCC days are the days set aside every quarter for optimization and experimentation **where** the whole company gathers in person. For example, my friend Malachi came up with an idea to speed up customer onboarding work. He built it over CCC days and it was soon integrated into our system. Beyond quarterly meetups, RoleModel also hosts an annual retreat where the employees are encouraged to bring their families. One of my friends at RoleModel got to attend these retreats with his dad years before he knew he was interested in coding. Even outside of work hours, Caleb Woods has fostered an incredible community. All the employees are friends. Many go to church together. They often played disc golf or pickleball after work.
