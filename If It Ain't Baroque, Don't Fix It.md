I sang my first solo to over 2,000 people at the "Let There Be Light" Christmas concert. Countless hours had been poured into crafting the concert, but no one was more essential to the project's success than the choir and orchestra director, Aaron Jackson. Only one thing was lacking in the whole arrangement, Aaron Jackson's face was toward the choir, not the audience. Aaron Jackson's eyes flowed with an intense energy that electrified the choir. If this energy had been condensed into a cup of coffee, it would have been enough to wake a paralytic. "Let There Be Light" indeed.

Aaron Jackson had a strong sense of humor. Once he opened up his Campbell University choir practice with one of his favorite one-liners: "If it ain't Baroque, don't fix it.” During one Wednesday night practice, our youth choir was singing a song that involved singing the word "Hallelujah." To Aaron Jackson's dismay, we were singing the end of the word "Hallelu - yuh" like the word "yummy." He instructed us to sing it like "Hallelu - yaw" like a German saying "Yah, man" or, even better, like my name: "Yah - cob" (“Jacob” with a twist.) Even more than what he said, Aaron Jackson expressed humor through his facial expressions and the brightness of his eyes — like how he described the choir’s proper expression: "From your nose down, your face should look like an opera singer; from your nose up, you should have the excitement of a first-grade teacher." Even when a choir member was difficult, his eyes shone — sometimes even brighter. On one Wednesday the youth choir made an egregious mistake, and upon hearing it, Aaron Jackson flung his music binder aside, flopped to the ground, and rolled around on the white, speckled linoleum floor — exclaiming, "Oh my stars..." in agony from hearing the painful disharmony.

Aaron Jackson had energy. He blazed through hours and hours of practice with the adult choir, youth choir, chamber choir, and orchestra on Wednesday and Sunday. Sometimes, he would be so excited about a musical piece he would ask the choir to repeat it for the sheer joy of it. In fact, he made the choir sing the Hallelujah Chorus perfectly three times consecutively. Aaron Jackson exuded energy while conducting too. Whether for a concert or Sunday church service, he would bounce while conducting the time signature — even working up a sweat. Aaron Jackson was where he wanted to be.

Aaron Jackson taught music with precision. For instance, he taught the choir to have "tall" vowels. Choirs often have "flat" vowels and, consequently, a collective southern accent. Such flat vowels might turn "A mighty fortress is our God" into "I my dee fort dress is are God." As Aaron Jackson would remind us, "We're not a country town choir, you know.” Tall vowels involve, instead of singing flat vowels like "Aw" as in the sound your doctor tells you to make, singing tall vowels like "Ah" as in the British pronunciation of "Top." It’s about opening the space behind your jaw like when you're yawning to gain greater resonance. Such resonance allows a listener to feel the vibration of the music, even from the back seat of an auditorium. A common tall vowel warmup we practiced was singing "ma, may, me, my, mow, mu" in unison, attempting to maintain the resonance from vowel to vowel. Aaron Jackson also taught coordinated consonants. Take "immense and free," for instance; it might easily be sung, "Immensss an free" _if_ consonants were disregarded. Instead, Aaron Jackson taught leaving the consonant off till the next word so "s"s don't fizzle out or worse, certain consonants disappear altogether. For example, we would sing "Immense and free," like "Immen san dfree," which may not sound great by itself but sounds great as a choir.

Besides enunciation, Aaron Jackson taught musical self-evaluation. He would often ask the choir to identify their mistakes like an alto volunteering "I think the altos were a little off-pitch" or a tenor saying "The bass section was too quiet" (because they always were.) One time, the youth choir (about 15 members) was singing on the Sunday after Easter when the tenors came in off-tune which made that song section sound weird. Instead of criticizing the error, Aaron Jackson later said with a smile, "Something went wrong. What do you think it was?" One of the students, incidentally the only tenor who could sing tenor, spoke up and said that he had sung the wrong note and led the tenor section to do the same. As soon as we analyzed the problem, there was nothing more to discuss. One incredible benefit of these analyses was that I learned an instinct for music. At the previous church, I had attempted improvised harmonization to common hymns, after my older brother who harmonized beautifully. But now, I could harmonize with any hymn I desired. Aaron Jackson put his life into the quality of his music, and it paid off.

Aaron Jackson achieved remarkable results. First, he built a talented musical community. Take Karen Bullock for instance: she could be given any complicated piece of sheet music she'd never seen before and play it perfectly... immediately. Out of the hours and hours she spent accompanying choir practice and performing, I've only heard her make one single mistake. Then there's the Danchi family. All four of the kids played violin and viola professionally, and two of the sisters were always in the orchestra. Furthermore, so many people were drawn to Aaron Jackson and his music program that there were more than enough people for a full choir and orchestra to perform weekly. Second, Aaron Jackson conducted beautiful concerts. He spent months selecting music for the annual Christmas concert. Sometimes only a month after the Christmas performance, Aaron Jackson would roll out his selection for the next year. But when this performance finally came, it was a big deal. The auditorium which could easily fit 1500 people was packed. Seats were lined against the wall, and they too were filled. I was thankful the youth choir had reserved seating; because we might have had to stand otherwise. But it was like he lived the music when Aaron Jackson stood on the conductor's podium (which would take him from about 5'8" to 6'2"). His face took on a heavenly visage and his eyes glowed with inner light. The music was deep, rich, resounding, pure, lovely. On that very stage, it was as if Aaron Jackson wielded the full power of music; music that melted hearts and touched souls. Aaron Jackson's music was heavenly.

But what struck me most about Aaron Jackson was his overwhelming joy. I had always been a happy kid, but that was because I didn't care. If I was ever disappointed, my ever-ready response was "Maybe tomorrow." But Aaron Jackson was happy because he did care. He cared so much about music that he dedicated his life to it. But how could someone be working and happy? I had no idea. But then I started noticing other people who had that same effervescent joy _and_ a passion for something beautiful.

Beth Grose was passionate about teaching science. Every year she would play "The Periodic Table of Elements" song for the new batch of chemistry students. She would bob her head from side to side and sing along to "There's hydrogen and helium, then lithium, beryllium." She even had a song for Polyatomic Ions too. No one could accuse Mrs. Grose of being boring! When it came time for the chemiluminescence lab, Mrs. Grose didn't miss anything. She got blackout blinds for the windows. She moved all 25 students and 12 tables into one room. And as soon as the reactants were mixed and all lights went off, Mrs. Grose would call out the time intervals — one minute, two minutes, three — and we would all write whether the chemicals in the glass vial were brighter than the minute before. We even measured whose reaction shone the brightest. Even after class, Mrs. Grose would talk about science-related topics — sometimes at great length. For example, she spent thirty minutes discussing screen radiation, citing studies showing phone-shaped tumors, and showing off her radiation-proof phone purse. Beth Grose was passionate about science.

Sue Gray was passionate about mock trial, having dedicated twenty years of her life to volunteer coaching. Mock trial is a simulated courtroom competition complete with attorneys, witnesses, affidavits, evidence, a judge, and a jury. The mock trial championship had three tiers: regional, state, and national. When the year's case was released, Mrs. Gray began to read the case with a furious intensity. Every week, she would quiz her students on their knowledge of the case. Every week, she would share discoveries she had made about the case. What's more, she would often read example testimony in character: an expert witness would become a superlative academic and the best friend of the deceased would become a distraught college student. Whenever student attorneys practiced objection arguments, "Judge" Gray would become an independent arbitrator and would rule in whichever way tested her students' case the most. Beyond class-time participation, Mrs. Gray expected a high level of independent collaboration. Some students would work over the phone for hours, and others would gather at each other's houses to study and discuss the case late into the night. But aside from the student community that these late-night studies formed, Mrs. Gray formed a community of attorneys, judges, and teachers passionate about mock trial. Several months before the regional tournaments, Mrs. Gray would organize a scrimmage match between about a dozen teams, recruiting an army of volunteer judges. Moreover, Mrs. Gray's friendships with the best coaches in the state enabled us to scrimmage against several advanced mock trial teams. But at the end of the year, whether or not our team won regionals, Mrs. Gray would hold her end-of-year award ceremony, praising by name every student's initiative, leadership, or growth. Teaching mock trial brought Sue Gray joy.

Caleb Woods, CEO of RoleModel Software, is passionate about growing his employees in "Character, Collaboration, and Craftsmanship" — the company motto. Craftsmanship at RoleModel begins with the "Academy" led by Caleb Woods. Every January, he carefully chooses the applicants for that year's Academy. This year, Mr. Woods chose some remarkable people for the Academy. Although techies and programmers are known for their poor communication skills, these three "academites" (as we call them) presented their education and backgrounds to the company so well over Zoom, that one of them had the entire company laughing. Beyond selecting people for the academy, Mr. Woods takes time from being CEO to teach the Academy in the "RoleModel Way" (best practices) of programming. Beyond technical teaching, Mr. Woods often gives lectures at our weekly "Chow and Pow-wow" about character. For example, several months ago he taught a lecture on listening titled "Ask and Adjust." But more than teach character, he leads by example. For instance, a few weeks after his lecture on listening and asking for feedback, he finished a lecture on leadership by asking the whole company if there were any ways he could lead better. He wanted to hear how he could improve anytime — from anyone. Beyond incredible humility, Mr. Woods fostered a strong community. Every quarter, the whole company gathers in person for paid experimentation time, so that any employee can contribute to the company's direction. Additionally, Caleb Woods holds a paid company retreat every year where the main event is personal growth and fellowship. Caleb Woods is passionate about the people of RoleModel Software.

Aaron Jackson rolled around on the floor. Beth Grose sang silly chemistry songs. Sue Gray whispered rhetorical questions. Caleb Woods advocated for shortcutting single keystrokes. These actions and passions they represent may seem silly and unrelatable. Although, I don't understand why some people like country, the joy is still real. But unlike entertainment where the show ends, the curtains close, and the credits scroll past, a true passion for teaching, performing, optimizing, or creating lasts. I've certainly felt it before. Sometimes when I'm playing piano or writing code, I feel the same inner fire. My younger brother can assure you: I can't comprehend anything beyond the piano when I'm playing — even if he's been trying to get my attention for several minutes. You've probably felt this joy before. Perhaps you felt it writing that essay about Shakespeare. Maybe it was that time you cooked those steaks to perfection. Maybe it was that time you fixed the lawn mower's carburetor. I never saw those times as opportunities. Work made me feel uncomfortable so I avoided it — in every form. But when I felt that passion, like that one Christmas when I couldn't stop playing "I Heard the Bells," I overlooked the joy and satisfaction that lay at my fingertips. I thought all work had to be endured... to eventually get around to the fun. I didn't know the joy that comes from great work. Do you?



Now instead of avoiding my work, I’m searching for work about which I can be passionate. Life is filled with toil, but for a rare few, their work brings joy. Beyond bringing delight to themselves, passionate people frequently bring purpose and fulfillment to their community.

Sue Gray was passionate about Mock Trial, a competitive form of speech and debate. Mock Trial is a full simulation of a civil or criminal case designed to expose students to the legal profession. Competitions were held annually at the local, state, and national levels, often at real courthouses with real judges. Mrs. Gray dedicated twenty years of volunteer work to this sport and hand-picked each member of her Mock Trial teams. As soon as the year's casebook was released, she was ready. Weekly, she would quiz the team on their knowledge of the case. Weekly, she would share new insights into the case. Whenever student attorneys practiced debating an objection, Mrs. Gray would preside as judge, letting the attorneys argue the objection till neither attorney had more to add. Then she ruled whichever way made the students' case more difficult, ensuring we were prepared for every contingency. Beyond classroom practice, Mrs. Gray expected a high level of independent collaboration. Students worked together over the phone for hours, rehearsing their arguments. Often students would have each other over to their house to collaborate late into the evening, and even later as the competitions drew nearer. But before the regional tournaments, Mrs. Gray would organize local scrimmages with the best teams in the state, recruiting professional attorneys to judge the Mock Trial rounds. Furthermore, Mrs. Gray recruited attorneys and judges for the regional and state tournaments too

Sue Gray was passionate about mock trial, a student simulation of civil or criminal cases with regional, state, and national competitions. For twenty years, Mrs. Gray taught high school speech and hand-picked her mock trial teams.  She was both enthusiastic and successful; many times her mock trial teams were state champions who got to compete at the national level. Each year as the mock trial case was released, she would ready her team:  weekly, she would quiz their knowledge of the case, and weekly, she would share new insights into the case. Some of my most beloved memories come from her playing the role of a courtroom judge.  When the student attorneys practiced making objections, more often than not Mrs. Grey would make outlandish and unpredictable rulings simply to prepare students for difficult contingencies that required that they revise their case strategy in real time.  Beyond mock trial team practice, Mrs. Gray expected a high level of independent collaboration. Students worked together over the phone for hours and often met in each others' homes late into the evening, especially as the competitions drew nearer.  

Additionally, to challenge her students, she would organize and host local scrimmages with the best teams in the state.

She even recruited real judges to preside over the regional tournaments. Amongst her students, many close relationships were formed. My older sister, for instance, is still in touch with several students she met in Mock Trial, one of whom became an attorney. In fact, my older sister helped Mrs. Gray write this year's Mock Trial case. Sue Grey found joy in coaching Mock Trial.

Every year teams compete at regional, state, and national levels for the championship title. Mrs. Gray dedicated twenty years of her life coaching mock trial, a job for which she was paid no more than the price of the raw case materials she gave her students. Eventually, she was nominated to the North Carolina Mock Trial Board of Directors. Mrs. Sue Gray taught her teams well, leading several teams to win state competitions and compete on the national level. As soon as the year's case was released, she began to read the case more than any of her students. Every week, she would quiz her students on their knowledge of the case and affidavits. Every week, she would share discoveries she had made about the case.

Sometimes her students would work over the phone for hours, and other times they would gather at each other's houses to study and discuss the case late into the night. Aside from her volunteering, Mrs. Sue Gray recruited countless attorneys and judges to judge the regional competitions and local scrimmages she hosted herself. At the end of the year, whether or not the team won regionals, Mrs. Gray would hold her end-of-year award ceremony, praising, by name, every student's initiative, leadership, or growth.
