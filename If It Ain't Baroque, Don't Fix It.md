Aaron Jackson was funny. Once when we were at Campbell University and Aaron Jackson was conducting the 300-member youth choir, Aaron Jackson began the choir practice with the joke: "If it ain't Baroque, don't fix it."  To this day, Aaron Jackson is the only person to invent a nickname for my name: Jacob. The youth choir was singing one song that involved singing the word "Hallelujah." To Aaron Jackson's dismay, we were singing the end of the word "Hallelu - yuh" like the word "yummy." He instructed us to sing it like "Hallelu - yaw" like a German saying "Yah, man" or, even better, like my name: "Yah - cob." That was my nickname at choir from that point on. Even more than what he said, Aaron Jackson expressed humor through his facial expressions and the brightness of his eyes — or as he described it when describing the choir's proper facial expression. "From your nose down, your face should look like an opera singer; from your nose up, you should have the excitement of a first-grade teacher." His eyes always shone in excitement like that of a magnetic first-grade teacher. Even when someone was being difficult, his eyes still shone — maybe even brighter. Aaron Jackson's most memorable use of humor was on one regular Wednesday evening choir practice with the adult choir. I don't remember what mistake the choir made, but I know it was egregious because, upon hearing their singing, Aaron Jackson dropped his music binder and rolled around on the white, speckled linoleum floor — as if in agony from hearing such a painful disharmony. Even when correcting the choir, Aaron Jackson made people laugh.

Aaron Jackson had energy. Every single week, Aaron Jackson introduced the songs with zest. Initially, I thought, "If he's this energetic now, he must be more relaxed later." It's like seeing a falling star that never actually fades; one that keeps orbiting the planet with the same burning brightness forever. Aaron Jackson was ALWAYS that energized. He was energized straight through hours and hours of practice with the Choir, Youth Choir, Chamber Choir, and Orchestra on Wednesday and Sunday. Sometimes, he would be so excited about a musical piece he would ask the choir to repeat a section just because he loved it. He made the choir sing the Hallelujah Chorus perfectly about three times consecutively because he loved it so much. And he wasn't the only one enjoying it: my younger brother and I got to sit in on the adult choir practice and pretend to be reading our books. Aaron Jackson exuded energy while conducting too. Whether for a concert or just Sunday service, he would literally bounce while conducting the time signature — even working up a sweat sometimes. He was energetic.

Aaron Jackson taught music with precision. For example, Aaron Jackson taught "tall vowels." A lot of choirs have "flat" vowels: where each choir member's drawl or slight accent compounds to a significant collective southern accent. This might turn "A mighty fortress is our God" into "I my dee fort dress is are God." As Aaron Jackson would remind us, "We're not a country town choir, you know." Having tall vowels involves changing flat vowels like "Aw" (like the sound your doctor tells you to make) into "Ah" like a British pronunciation of "Top hat" and opening the space behind your jaw (like when you're yawning). Such vowels allow you to hear the resonance of your own singing. The final effect is a choir that has a deep and resounding sound that you can feel from the back seat of a large auditorium. One common tall vowel warmup was singing "ma, may, me, my, mow, mu" in unison, trying to maintain the resonance from vowel to vowel. Aaron Jackson also taught coordinated consonants. Take "immense and free," for instance; it might easily be sung, "Immensss an free" if consonants were disregarded. Instead, Aaron Jackson taught leaving the consonant off till the next word so "s"s don't fissile out or worse, certain consonants disappear altogether. For example, we would sing "Immense and free," like "Immen san dfree," which may not sound right solo but sounds great as a choir. 

Besides enunciation, Aaron Jackson taught musical self-evaluation. He would often ask the choir to identify their own mistakes like an alto volunteering "I think the altos were a little off-pitch." or a tenor saying "The bass section was too quiet." One time, the youth choir (about 15 members) was singing on the Sunday after Easter when the tenors came in off-tune which made that song section sound weird. Instead of criticizing the error, Aaron Jackson later said with a smile, "Something went wrong. What do you think it was?" One of the students, incidentally the only tenor who could sing tenor, spoke up and said that he had sung the wrong note and led the tenor section to do the same. As soon as we analyzed the problem, there was nothing more to discuss. One incredible benefit of these analyses was that I learned an instinct for music. At the previous church, I had attempted improvised harmonization to common hymns, after my older brother who harmonized beautifully. But now, I could harmonize with any hymn I desired, despite my honking teenage voice. Aaron Jackson put his life into the quality of his music, and it paid off.

Aaron Jackson achieved remarkable results. First, he built a talented musical community. Take Karen Bullock for instance: she could be given any complicated piece of piano music she'd never seen and play it perfectly... immediately. Out of the hours and hours she spent accompanying choir practice and performing, I've only heard her make one single mistake. Then there's the Danchi family. All four of the kids played violin and viola professionally, and two of the sisters were always in the orchestra. Furthermore, so many people were drawn to Aaron Jackson and his music program, that there were more than enough people for a full choir and orchestra to perform every week. Second, Aaron Jackson conducted beautiful concerts. He spent months selecting music for the annual Christmas concert. Sometimes only a month after the Christmas performance, Aaron Jackson would roll out his selection for the next year. But when this performance finally came, it was a big deal. The auditorium which could easily fit 1500 people was packed. Seats were lined against the wall, and they too were filled. I was thankful the youth choir had reserved seating; because we might have had to stand otherwise. But when he stood on the conductor's podium (which would take him from about 5'8" to 6'2"), it was like he lived the music. The music was deep, rich, resounding, pure, lovely. It was as if Aaron Jackson on that stage wielded the very power of music; music that melted hearts and touched souls. Aaron Jackson's music was heavenly.

I shared Aaron Jackson's energy for music, but when it came time for school, all motivation was lost. I spent hours upon hours sitting at my desk pretending to be working. I wasn't pretending well enough because I never actually got anything done — besides carving my name into the soft wooden desk with a mechanical pencil (which can hardly be called productive). Many times my Mom would exhort me to work hard and encourage these exhortations with various threats, consequences, and potential rewards. One time she asked me, "Well? Don't you want to get your school done?" My response was "What would I do if I got done?" This was staggering. It was beyond my mother's understanding — that someone, anyone, could be so passive and negligent as to have no desire to do anything but daydream *instead* of working. The most prominent illustration of this was my attempt at writing an essay on the subject of laziness. A video recording of my "writing process" would have described more about laziness than my essay *eventually* did. I spent whole days rearranging abstract words that meant nothing to me. Oh, it was excruciating. I was lazy for one reason: I didn't like effort. I would do anything to avoid giving effort, except being diligent, of course. The "Laziness Essay" would have taken less time and required less effort if I had been truly diligent.

But eventually, I began to notice people (including "Aaron Jackson") who were genuinely motivated. How could they stay motivated and happy simultaneously? They pursued what they were good at, their unique gifts from God. In the process, they accomplished great things and found joy in their work — an apparent contradiction in my mind at the time.

Mrs. Sue Grey did what she was made to do. She was my public speaking teacher first and my Mock Trial coach later on. She had energy. Aaron Jackson only compared to first-grade teachers; Mrs. Grey *was* a former first-grade teacher and former clown. In fact, in public speaking class, she would talk to specific students instead of the class at large, sometimes whispering — using their first and middle names to address them. Though this technique shattered a few personal space bubbles, it gripped the class's attention like nothing else. Her energy showed in Mock Trial too. Mock Trial is a speech and debate format oriented around a faux court case with witnesses, attorneys, a judge, and a jury. Mrs. Grey always had the funniest theme ideas for the opening and closing arguments. In the overdose lawsuit case, she proposed the theme, "You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink." This theme was rejected by the team outright; it compared humans to horses and taking opioids to drinking water. Impossible. Mrs. Grey was passionate about speaking. She could have done other work that would have been easier and more comfortable, but she chose to do what she loved despite the obstinate teenagers.

Steve Noble does what he loves, preparing students for the real world. Steve Nobel teaches civics and ethics at a local co-op and runs his podcast The Steve Noble Show. Both of Mr. Noble's classes are aimed at preparing the next generation. In his civics class, for example, he spent over half of a lecture talking about the U.S. Debt Clock (a .gov website tallying the American debt accrual) and all of its national sovereignty implications. In his ethics class, Steve Noble taught ethical decision-making on sticky topics such as abortion, war, and torture. Mr. Noble is a really smart man and could easily make better money doing something different, but he doesn't. He does the hard work of preparing students for real-life issues, something he loves.

John Calvin Young is gifted at what he does. John Calvin is a Software Craftsman at RoleModel Software and a genius. 

Once during my time in "Academy" at said RoleModel Software, John Calvin overheard a fellow academite and me discussing whether Star Wars lasers were "realistic." He wouldn't miss an opportunity like that. He told us the lore of Star Wars lasers. Furthermore, he explained the "recent" (several months old) news story of Israel's real-life, anti-missile laser gun. The problem with Israel's "Iron Dome" anti-missile strategy was that it involved launching tons of precise but costly anti-missiles, whereas the missiles launched into urban areas by Hamas and other groups, were cheap, imprecise, and mass-produced — any hit would cause immense damage. In response to this dilemma, Israel developed a laser gun, which John Calvin described in detail. He described how this laser gun was mounted on the back of something like a water truck — and with good reason. The main difficulty with this high-power laser was cooling it down. The lens of the laser alone reached inconceivable temperatures. He told me how he was primarily interested in the targeting systems. He told me the exact energy cost per "blast." He told me the news article's estimate on how long the investment in weapon development would take to pay itself off per shot. He remembered all these details like it was yesterday. 

Besides having the largest and broadest memory of anyone I know, John Calvin has incredible problem-solving power. One time I was taking a break at work and decided to ask John Calvin what he'd been working on. His face lit up and he said, "Oh you're going to like this!" He took me over to his whiteboard which was already overflowing onto the adjacent one. He began explaining. He was working with 10k+ point fields modeling terrain from which he was attempting to carve something like a road. The problem with such large data models is iterating takes a lot of time. For example, you might be able to hand
