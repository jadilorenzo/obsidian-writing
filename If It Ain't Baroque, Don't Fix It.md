Aaron Jackson was funny. 
Once when we were at Campbell University and Aaron Jackson was conducting the 300-member youth choir, Aaron Jackson began the choir practice with the joke: "If it ain't Baroque, don't fix it." 
His most memorable use of humor was on one regular Wednesday evening choir practice with the adult choir.
