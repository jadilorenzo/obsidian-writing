I was 14 when I sang my first solo... in front of a crowd of over 2,000 people. It was the annual Christmas concert at Christ Baptist Church, and the year's theme was "Let There Be Light." Countless hours had been poured into crafting the concert, but no one was more essential to the project's success than the choir and orchestra director, Aaron Jackson. Only one thing was lacking in the whole arrangement, Aaron Jackson's face was toward the choir, not the audience. And in those moments, the experience from the choir's perspective was a dimension above the audience's. Aaron Jackson's face, specifically his eyes, flowed with an intense energy and light that electrified the choir. Had this energy been condensed into a cup of coffee, it would have been more than enough to wake a paralytic. "Let There Be Light" indeed.

Aaron Jackson was funny. Once when we were at Campbell University, Aaron Jackson was conducting a 300-member youth choir. He began the practice with one of his favorite one-liners: "If it ain't Baroque, don't fix it."  On one Wednesday, our youth choir was singing a song that involved singing the word "Hallelujah." To Aaron Jackson's dismay, we were singing the end of the word "Hallelu - yuh" like the word "yummy." He instructed us to sing it like "Hallelu - yaw" like a German saying "Yah, man" or, even better, like my name: "Yah - cob" (my choir nickname from that point on.) Even more than what he said, Aaron Jackson expressed humor through his facial expressions and the brightness of his eyes — or as he described it when describing the choir's proper facial expression: "From your nose down, your face should look like an opera singer; from your nose up, you should have the excitement of a first-grade teacher." He always had first-grade-teacher-level excitement. Even when someone was being difficult, his eyes still shone — sometimes even brighter. Aaron Jackson's most memorable use of humor was on one Wednesday evening youth choir practice. I don't remember what mistake we made, but I know it was egregious. Upon hearing our singing, Aaron Jackson flung his music binder aside, dropped to the ground, and rolled around on the white, speckled linoleum floor — exclaiming, "Oh my stars..." in agony from hearing this painful disharmony. Even when correcting the choir, Aaron Jackson made people laugh.

Aaron Jackson had energy. Every single week, Aaron Jackson introduced the songs with zest. Initially, I thought, "If he's this energetic now, he must be more relaxed later." It's like seeing a falling star that never actually fades; a comet that keeps orbiting the planet with the same burning brightness forever. Aaron Jackson was ALWAYS that energized. He blazed through hours and hours of practice with the Choir, Youth Choir, Chamber Choir, and Orchestra on Wednesday and Sunday. Sometimes, he would be so excited about a musical piece he would ask the choir to repeat a section for the thrill of it. He made the choir sing the Hallelujah Chorus perfectly about three times consecutively because he loved it so much. And he wasn't the only one enjoying it: my younger brother and I got to sit in on the adult choir practice and pretend to be reading our books. Aaron Jackson exuded energy while conducting too. Whether for a concert or Sunday service, he would bounce while conducting the time signature — even working up a sweat sometimes. He was energetic.

Aaron Jackson taught music with precision. For example, Aaron Jackson taught "tall vowels." A lot of choirs have "flat" vowels: where each choir member's drawl or slight accent compounds to a significant collective southern accent. This might turn "A mighty fortress is our God" into "I my dee fort dress is are God." As Aaron Jackson would remind us, "We're not a country town choir, you know." Having tall vowels involves changing flat vowels like "Aw" (like the sound your doctor tells you to make) into "Ah" like a British pronunciation of "Top" and opening the space behind your jaw like when you're yawning. Such vowels allow you to achieve resonance while singing. The final effect is a choir that has a deep and resounding sound that you can feel from the back seat of a large auditorium. One common tall vowel warmup was singing "ma, may, me, my, mow, mu" in unison to maintain the resonance from vowel to vowel. Aaron Jackson also taught coordinated consonants. Take "immense and free," for instance; it might easily be sung, "Immensss an free" if consonants were disregarded. Instead, Aaron Jackson taught leaving the consonant off till the next word so "s"s don't fissile out or worse, certain consonants disappear altogether. For example, we would sing "Immense and free," like "Immen san dfree," which may not sound right solo but sounds great as a choir. 

Besides enunciation, Aaron Jackson taught musical self-evaluation. He would often ask the choir to identify their mistakes like an alto volunteering "I think the altos were a little off-pitch." or a tenor saying "The bass section was too quiet" (because they always were.) One time, the youth choir (about 15 members) was singing on the Sunday after Easter when the tenors came in off-tune which made that song section sound weird. Instead of criticizing the error, Aaron Jackson later said with a smile, "Something went wrong. What do you think it was?" One of the students, incidentally the only tenor who could sing tenor, spoke up and said that he had sung the wrong note and led the tenor section to do the same. As soon as we analyzed the problem, there was nothing more to discuss. One incredible benefit of these analyses was that I learned an instinct for music. At the previous church, I had attempted improvised harmonization to common hymns, after my older brother who harmonized beautifully. But now, I could harmonize with any hymn I desired, despite my honking teenage voice. Aaron Jackson put his life into the quality of his music, and it paid off.

Aaron Jackson achieved remarkable results. First, he built a talented musical community. Take Karen Bullock for instance: she could be given any complicated piece of piano music she'd never seen and play it perfectly... immediately. Out of the hours and hours she spent accompanying choir practice and performing, I've only heard her make one single mistake. Then there's the Danchi family. All four of the kids played violin and viola professionally, and two of the sisters were always in the orchestra. Furthermore, so many people were drawn to Aaron Jackson and his music program that there were more than enough people for a full choir and orchestra to perform weekly. Second, Aaron Jackson conducted beautiful concerts. He spent months selecting music for the annual Christmas concert. Sometimes only a month after the Christmas performance, Aaron Jackson would roll out his selection for the next year. But when this performance finally came, it was a big deal. The auditorium which could easily fit 1500 people was packed. Seats were lined against the wall, and they too were filled. I was thankful the youth choir had reserved seating; because we might have had to stand otherwise. But it was like he lived the music when Aaron Jackson stood on the conductor's podium (which would take him from about 5'8" to 6'2"). His face took on a heavenly visage and his eyes glowed with inner light. The music was deep, rich, resounding, pure, lovely. On that very stage, it was as if Aaron Jackson wielded the full power of music; music that melted hearts and touched souls.  Aaron Jackson's music was heavenly.

But what struck me most about Aaron Jackson was his overwhelming joy. I had always been a happy kid, but that was because I didn't care. If I was ever disappointed, my ever-ready response was "Maybe tomorrow." But Aaron Jackson was happy because he did care. He cared so much about music that he dedicated his life to it. But how could someone be working and happy? I had no idea. But then I started noticing other people who had that same effervescent joy *and* a passion for something beautiful.
 
Beth Grose was passionate about teaching science. Every year she would play "The Periodic Table of Elements" song for the new batch of chemistry students. She would bob her head from side to side and sing along to "There's hydrogen and helium, then lithium, beryllium." She even had a song for Polyatomic Ions too. No one could accuse Mrs. Grose of being boring! When it came time for the chemiluminescence lab, Mrs. Grose didn't miss anything. She got blackout blinds for the windows. She moved all 25 students and 12 tables into one room. As soon as the reactants were mixed and all lights went off, Mrs. Grose would call out the time intervals — one minute, two minutes, three — and we would all write whether the chemicals in the glass vial were brighter than the minute before. We even measured whose reaction shone the brightest. 
Even after class, Mrs. Grose would talk about science-related topics — sometimes at great length. For example, she spent thirty minutes discussing screen radiation, citing studies showing phone-shaped tumors, and showing off her radiation-proof phone purse. Beth Grose was passionate about science.

Sue Grey was passionate about public speaking. In her public speaking class, she demonstrated proper public speaking techniques with drama. She would interrupt her lecture, stand in front of some student's desk, lean over, and whisper something like, "Jacob... Do you know why a monotone is boring?" Suddenly, every student in the class was listening with rapt attention. She would then break loose of the sudden intensity and continue her fascinating monologue on the monotone. She changed the speed of her speech too. One moment she would be ferociously spitting out words like hailstones falling from the sky. The next, she would be letting her words fall with a ponderous heaviness like water droplets falling from a leaking faucet in an abandoned house. Out of the students in her speech class, Mrs. Grey would often select students to join Mock Trial, a competitive form of speech and debate to which she devoted twenty years of volunteer work. Mock Trial is a full trial simulation, complete with affidavits, witnesses, evidence, a judge, a jury, and attorneys. Furthermore, the state championships would often take place in real courtrooms with real judges. Mrs. Grey led her teams with such excellence that several teams competed on a national level. Whenever it came time for the regional championship, everyone was excited — but none more than Mrs. Grey. She spoke faster than ever and her dramatic gestures became frenetic. But she had prepared her students well. My older sister Christiana, for instance, was so immersed in playing the role of Blake Spoulder, a forensic expert, and her argument became so real, that she started asking the attorney questions. The attorney (another student) had to catch herself so she didn't answer Christiana's questions and said "Wait a second... I thought I was supposed to be the one asking the questions." Aside from the skills shown and developed in the competitions themselves, several of Mrs. Grey's Mock Trial team members went on to become real attorneys and pass the bar exam. Sue Grey taught public speaking with excellence and passion.

Caleb Woods is passionate about optimizing. Caleb Woods is the owner and CEO of the RoleModel Software consulting company. Every Friday, RoleModel Software has what is called a Chow and Pow-Wow, where the company shares a meal (even over Zoom) and various members present on various topics — such as John Calvin Young's "The Case of The Uncreated Index" or Mark Kraemer's "The Science of Motivation." One of my favorite presentations was Caleb Woods's presentation on keyboard shortcuts. Developers love customization, but Mr. Woods was extra-passionate about keyboard shortcuts. He showed how almost all developer tools and websites had uniform navigation shortcuts: "H," "J," "K," and "L". He talked about using "^Tab" and "^Shift-Tab" for tab navigation. He even advocated using "⌘X" over "⌘C + Delete" because it saved a single keystroke. Above all, he encouraged using file switchers (⌘P) and command pallets (⌘Shift-P) instead of inefficiently moving your cursor all over the place. But Mr. Wood's passion for optimizing goes beyond shortcuts. One week, after giving a lecture on maximizing impact, Mr. Woods opened the discussion up to the whole company by asking "Where are we inefficient? Where are those little inefficiencies that can add up to lots of wasted time?" Several inefficiencies were considered — some of which Mr. Woods had already planned to amend. But what struck me was the humility: Mr. Woods knew there were inefficiencies, and he knew he couldn't see all of them. Caleb Woods took optimizing to a whole new level.

Aaron Jackson rolled around on the floor. Beth Grose sang silly chemistry songs. Sue Grey whispered rhetorical questions. Caleb Woods advocated for shortcutting single keystrokes. These actions and passions they represent may seem silly and unrelatable. Although I don't understand why some people like country, the joy is still real. But unlike entertainment where the show ends, the curtains close, and the credits scroll past, a true passion for teaching, performing, optimizing, or creating lasts. I've certainly felt it before. Sometimes when I'm playing piano or writing code, I feel the same inner fire. My younger brother can assure you: I can't comprehend anything beyond the piano when I'm playing — even if he's been trying to get my attention for several minutes. You've probably felt this joy before. Perhaps you felt it writing that essay about Shakespeare. Maybe it was that time you cooked those steaks to perfection. Maybe it was that time you fixed the lawn mower's carburetor. I never saw those times were opportunities. Work made me feel uncomfortable so I avoided it — in every form. But when I felt that passion, like that one Christmas when I couldn't stop playing "I Heard the Bells," I overlooked the joy and satisfaction that lay at my fingertips. I thought all work had to be endured... to eventually get around to the fun. I didn't know the joy that comes from great work. Do you?

Whether it was conducting an orchestra, singing a silly chemistry song, whispering to a class of uncomfortable students, or discussing time-saving shortcuts for developers, these people found a rare joy because of their passion for their work. Some think that such joy is a personality trait, like extroversion which one might acquire at birth. Some think it is naiveté, a blindness to pain and difficulty.  I thought it was the natural outcome of a life of comfort, one without hurry or work. But it is none of these. Lasting joy is found by pursuing something meaningful, not by avoiding responsibility or work. 

Aaron Jackson spent his life creating music because it was beautiful. Mrs. Grose found chemistry beautiful in its balance. To Mrs. Grey, nothing was more beautiful and valuable than a persuasive speech delivered with conviction and clarity. Mr. Woods had such a love for his business, that he wanted to see it optimized down the last keystroke.

Their joy became a joy to me. Their passion ignited a passion within me. The beauty they sought and created became beautiful to me — even if I had never known its value before. 

I've had moments of joy and purpose while doing various types of work. However, as soon as these moments are over, I go on with my ordinary life and forget these moments.

We forget when we have these moments of joy. We don't seek them in the right places. As a teen, you need to look for purpose.

Recently, I've discovered myself enjoying doing hard things 
I've recently noticed myself
While working on piano or programming,

I've begun to notice a disturbing trend when I'm working on something like piano or programming — I enjoy the work. Is it hard? Certainly. I get the same brain fog one might get after taking a long test. But it's rewarding. I made something. I played something. But then I move on to whatever is next and forget the bliss I've just left. Often I find myself craving that satisfaction, but unwilling to pay the price of hard work. Often, I expect to find that fulfillment in entertainment like a good movie or song, but it isn't the same. 

**Plan for the last paragraph:**
These passions may seem silly
List them.
Un-relatable 
Each person is different
The joy is real
The joy lasts
I've felt it myself
You've probably felt it yourself
what's your good work
What's keeping you from staying there (in a state of passionate work) longer
Laziness and Initiative for me
Business, poor scheduling, unawareness
how many people are unhappy because they didn't know heaven was found in good work
"There's no better place on earth, than the road that leads to heaven"
