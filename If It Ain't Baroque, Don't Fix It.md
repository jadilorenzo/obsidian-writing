Aaron Jackson was funny. Once when we were at Campbell University and Aaron Jackson was conducting the 300-member youth choir, Aaron Jackson began the choir practice with the joke: "If it ain't Baroque, don't fix it."  To this day, Aaron Jackson is the only person to invent a nickname for my name: Jacob. The youth choir was singing one song that involved singing the word "Hallelujah." To Aaron Jackson's dismay, we were singing the end of the word "Hallelu - yuh" like the word "yummy." He instructed us to sing it like "Hallelu - yaw" like a German saying "Yah, man" or, even better, like my name: "Yah - cob." That was my nickname at choir from that point on. Even more than what he said, Aaron Jackson expressed humor through his facial expressions and the brightness of his eyes — or as he described it when describing the choir's proper facial expression. "From your nose down, your face should look like an opera singer; from your nose up, you should have the excitement of a first-grade teacher." His eyes always shone in excitement like that of a magnetic first-grade teacher. Even when someone was being difficult, his eyes still shone — maybe even brighter. Aaron Jackson's most memorable use of humor was on one regular Wednesday evening choir practice with the adult choir. I don't remember what mistake the choir made, but I know it was egregious because, upon hearing their singing, Aaron Jackson dropped his music binder and rolled around on the white, speckled linoleum floor — as if in agony from hearing such a painful disharmony. Even when correcting the choir, Aaron Jackson made people laugh.

Aaron Jackson had energy. Every single week, Aaron Jackson introduced the songs with zest. Initially, I thought, "If he's this energetic now, he must be more relaxed later." It's like seeing a falling star that never actually fades; one that keeps orbiting the planet with the same burning brightness forever. Aaron Jackson was ALWAYS that energized. He was energized straight through hours and hours of practice with the Choir, Youth Choir, Chamber Choir, and Orchestra on Wednesday and Sunday. Sometimes, he would be so excited about a musical piece he would ask the choir to repeat a section just because he loved it. He made the choir sing the Hallelujah Chorus perfectly about three times consecutively because he loved it so much. And he wasn't the only one enjoying it: my younger brother and I got to sit in on the adult choir practice and pretend to be reading our books. Aaron Jackson exuded energy while conducting too. Whether for a concert or just Sunday service, he would literally bounce while conducting the time signature — even working up a sweat sometimes. He was energetic.

Aaron Jackson taught music with precision. For example, Aaron Jackson taught "tall vowels." A lot of choirs have "flat" vowels: where each choir member's drawl or slight accent compounds to a significant collective southern accent. This might turn "A mighty fortress is our God" into "I my dee fort dress is are God." As Aaron Jackson would remind us, "We're not a country town choir, you know." Having tall vowels involves changing flat vowels like "Aw" (like the sound your doctor tells you to make) into "Ah" like a British pronunciation of "Top hat" and opening the space behind your jaw (like when you're yawning). Such vowels allow you to hear the resonance of your own singing. The final effect is a choir that has a deep and resounding sound that you can feel from the back seat of a large auditorium. One common tall vowel warmup was singing "ma, may, me, my, mow, mu" in unison, trying to maintain the resonance from vowel to vowel. Aaron Jackson also taught coordinated consonants. Take "immense and free," for instance; it might easily be sung, "Immensss an free" if consonants were disregarded. Instead, Aaron Jackson taught leaving the consonant off till the next word so "s"s don't fissile out or worse, certain consonants disappear altogether. For example, we would sing "Immense and free," like "Immen san dfree," which may not sound right solo but sounds great as a choir. 

Besides enunciation, Aaron Jackson taught musical self-evaluation. He would often ask the choir to identify their own mistakes like an alto volunteering "I think the altos were a little off-pitch." or a tenor saying "The bass section was too quiet." One time, the youth choir (about 15 members) was singing on the Sunday after Easter when the tenors came in off-tune which made that song section sound weird. Instead of criticizing the error, Aaron Jackson later said with a smile, "Something went wrong. What do you think it was?" One of the students, incidentally the only tenor who could sing tenor, spoke up and said that he had sung the wrong note and led the tenor section to do the same. As soon as we analyzed the problem, there was nothing more to discuss. One incredible benefit of these analyses was that I learned an instinct for music. At the previous church, I had attempted improvised harmonization to common hymns, after my older brother who harmonized beautifully. But now, I could harmonize with any hymn I desired, despite my honking teenage voice. Aaron Jackson put his life into the quality of his music, and it paid off.

Aaron Jackson achieved remarkable results. 
First, he built a talented musical community. Take Karen Bullock for instance: she could be given any complicated piece of piano music she'd never seen and play it perfectly... immediately. Out of the hours and hours she spent accompanying choir practice and performing, I've only heard her make one single mistake. Then there's the Danchi family. All four of the kids played violin and viola professionally, and two of the sisters were always in the orchestra. Furthermore, so many people were drawn to Aaron Jackson and his music program, that there were more than enough people for a full choir and orchestra to perform every week.
Second, Aaron Jackson conducted beautiful concerts. He spent
