Aaron Jackson was funny. 
Once when we were at Campbell University and Aaron Jackson was conducting the 300-member youth choir, Aaron Jackson began the choir practice with the joke: "If it ain't Baroque, don't fix it." 
His most memorable use of humor was on one regular Wednesday evening choir practice with the adult choir. I don't remember what mistake the choir made, but I know it was egregious because, upon hearing their singing, he dropped his music binder and rolled around on the white, speckled linoleum floor — as if in agony from hearing such a painful disharmony.
In addition, to this day, Aaron Jackson is the only person to invent a nickname for my name: Jacob. The youth choir was singing one song that involved singing the word "Hallelujah." To Aaron Jackson's dismay, we were singing that word "Hallelu - yuh" as in "yummy." He instructed us to sing it like "Hallelu - yaw" like a German saying "Yah, man" or, even better, like my name: "Yah - cob."
Even more than what he said, Aaron Jackson expressed humor through his facial expressions and the brightness of his eyes — or as he described it when describing the choir's proper facial expression. "From your nose down, your face should look like an opera singer; from your nose up, you should have the excitement of a first-grade teacher." His eyes always shone in excitement like that of an energetic first-grade teacher. Even when someone was being difficult, his eyes still shone — maybe even brighter.
Even when correcting the choir, Aaron Jackson made people laugh.

Aaron Jackson had energy. 
Every single week, Aaron Jackson introduced the songs with zest. Initially, I thought, "If he's this energetic now, he must be more relaxed later." It's like seeing a falling star that never actually fades, it just keeps orbiting the planet with the same burning brightness forever. Aaron Jackson was ALWAYS that energized.
He was energized straight through hours and hours of practice with the Choir, Youth Choir, Chamber Choir, and Orchestra on Wednesday and Sunday.
Sometimes, he would be so excited about a musical piece he would ask the choir to repeat a section. He made the choir sing the Hallelujah Chorus perfectly about three times consecutively because he loved it so much. And he wasn't the only one enjoying it: my younger brother and I got to sit in on the adult choir practice and pretend to be reading our books.
Aaron Jackson exuded energy while performing too. Whether for a concert or just Sunday service, he would literally bounce while conducting the time signature — even working up a sweat sometimes.
He was energetic.
