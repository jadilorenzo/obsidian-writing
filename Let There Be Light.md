We had reached the final song of the "Let There Be Light" Christmas concert, and I sang the opening solo to a crowd of over two thousand people. Countless hours had been poured into crafting the concert, but no one invested more time and effort than the choir and orchestra director, Aaron Jackson. He led the choir and orchestra with precision, patience, persistence, and an exceptional sense of humor. What's more, Aaron Jackson brought an energetic joy that electrified the choir. If this energy had been condensed into a cup of coffee, it would have wakened a paralytic — "Let There Be Light" indeed.

Aaron Jackson had a strong sense of humor. Once he opened up his Campbell University joint choir practice with one of his favorite one-liners: "If it ain't Baroque, don't fix it.” During one Wednesday night practice, our youth choir was singing a song that involved singing the word "Hallelujah." To Aaron Jackson's dismay, we were singing the end of the word "Hallelu - yuh" like the word "yummy." He instructed us to sing it like "Hallelu - yaw" like a German saying "Yah, man" or, even better, like my name: "Yah - cob" ("Jacob" with a twist.) Even more than what he said, Aaron Jackson expressed humor through his facial expressions and the brightness of his eyes — like how he described the choir's proper expression: "From your nose down, your face should look like an opera singer; from your nose up, you should have the excitement of a first-grade teacher." Even when a choir member was difficult, his eyes shone — sometimes even brighter. One Wednesday, the youth choir warbled hideously out of tune, and upon hearing it, Aaron Jackson flung his music binder aside, flopped to the ground, and rolled around on the white, speckled linoleum floor — exclaiming, "Oh my stars..." in agony from hearing the painful disharmony.

Aaron Jackson had energy. Every Wednesday and Sunday, he blazed through hours and hours of practice with the adult choir, youth choir, chamber choir, and orchestra. Sometimes, he would be so excited about a musical piece he would ask the choir to repeat it out of sheer joy. In fact, he made the choir repeat the Hallelujah Chorus perfectly three times. When conducting, Aaron Jackson's entire body would take on the song's rhythm and timbre: he would bob up and down on his knees, his right arm would precisely meter out the time signature, and his face would become the expression of the music. If the song was bold and resounding, he performed wide and sweeping gestures and wore an expression of intense valor. Aaron Jackson was where he wanted to be.

Aaron Jackson taught music with precision. For instance, he taught the choir to have "tall" vowels. Choirs often have "flat" vowels and, consequently, a collective southern accent. Such flat vowels might turn "A mighty fortress is our God" into "I my dee fort dress is are God." As Aaron Jackson would remind us, "We're not a country town choir, you know.” These tall vowels are created by opening the space near the back of your jaw — similar to when you yawn. This space will change a tinny "me" into a resonant "may," and such resonance allows a listener to feel the vibration of the music, even from the back seat of an auditorium. Aaron Jackson also taught coordinated consonants. For instance, if consonants were disregarded, "immense and free," would easily become, "Immensss an free". Instead, Aaron Jackson taught leaving the consonant off till the next word so "s"s don't fizzle out or, worse, certain consonants disappear altogether. For example, we would sing "Immense and free," like "Immen san dfree," which may not sound great by itself but sounds great as a choir.

Aaron Jackson also taught musical self-evaluation. He would often ask the choir to identify their mistakes like an alto volunteering "I think the altos were a little off-pitch" or a tenor saying "The bass section was too quiet" (because they always were.)  On the Sunday after one Easter, the youth choir (about 15 members) was singing when the tenors came in off-tune. When Aaron Jackson later asked what went wrong, the lead tenor, the only youth who could truly sing the tenor part, took the mistake upon himself and admitted to leading the tenor section in singing the wrong note. These analyses taught me an ear for music. For example, before joining the youth choir, I had attempted to harmonize with little success, but now, I could harmonize with any hymn on the spot. Furthermore, I began to experiment on the piano, eventually sounding out my favorite song, "Faded." Aaron Jackson taught music with excellence.

Aaron Jackson achieved remarkable results. First, he built a talented musical community. For instance, the piano accompanist, Karen Bullock, could take any piece of sheet music play it perfectly first try. Out of the hours and hours she spent accompanying choir practice and performing, I've heard her only make one mistake. Then there's the Danchi family. All four kids played violin and viola professionally, and two sisters played in the orchestra weekly. Furthermore, so many people were drawn to Aaron Jackson and his music program that there were more than enough people for a full choir and orchestra to perform weekly. Second, Aaron Jackson conducted beautiful concerts. He spent months selecting music for the annual Christmas concert. Sometimes only a month after the Christmas performance, Aaron Jackson would roll out his selection for the next year. But when this performance finally came, it was a big deal. The auditorium, which could easily fit 1500 people, was packed. Seats were lined against the wall, and they too were filled. I was thankful the youth choir had reserved seating; otherwise, we might have had to stand. Aaron Jackson lived the music when he stood on the conductor's podium. His face took on a heavenly visage and his eyes glowed with inner light. The music was deep, rich, resounding, pure, lovely. On that very stage, it was as if Aaron Jackson wielded the full power of music: music that melted hearts and touched souls. Aaron Jackson's music was heavenly.

But was Aaron Jackson's energetic joy unique in my experience? No. Unlike many homeschool students, nearly all my teachers and mentors have been interesting and energetic. For a long time, I assumed these traits were dual eccentricities. But then I discovered that these people were the same in one vital way: they were energized by hard work that they loved.

%% Aaron Jackson's jet fuel was his love for music. %%

Beth Grose, for instance, loved teaching science. Every year she would play "The Periodic Table of Elements" song for the new batch of chemistry students. She would bouncing her head from side to side and sing along to "There's hydrogen and helium, then lithium, beryllium." She even had a song for Polyatomic Ions too. No one in their right mind could accuse Mrs. Grose of being boring! Even during her lectures, she would interrupt relevant course study to answer students' random questions such as "Why is hydrogen used in hydrogen bombs?" When it came time for the chemiluminescence lab, Mrs. Grose prepared everything. She got blackout blinds for the windows and moved all 25 students and 12 tables into one room. As soon as the reactants were mixed and all lights went off, Mrs. Grose would call out the time intervals — one minute, two minutes, three — and we would all write whether the chemicals in the glass vial were brighter than the minute before. We even measured whose reaction shone the brightest. Even after class, Mrs. Grose would talk about science-related topics — sometimes at great length. For example, she spent thirty minutes discussing screen radiation, citing studies showing phone-shaped tumors, and showing off her radiation-proof phone purse. Inspiring others to be passionate about science brought Beth Grose joy.
%% Mrs. Grose made labs something worth remembering. %%

Sue Gray was passionate about mock trial, having dedicated twenty years of her life to volunteer coaching. Mock trial is a simulated courtroom competition complete with attorneys, witnesses, affidavits, evidence, a judge, and a jury. The mock trial championship had three tiers: regional, state, and national. When the year's case was released, Mrs. Gray began to read the case with a furious intensity. Every week, she would quiz her students on their knowledge of the case. Every week, she would share discoveries she had made about the case. What's more, she would often perform example testimony in character: an expert witness would become a superlative academic and the best friend of the deceased would become a distraught college student. Whenever student attorneys practiced objection arguments, "Judge" Gray became an independent arbitrator and ruled in whichever way seemed to her most inconvenient to her students' case. Beyond class-time participation, Mrs. Gray expected a high level of independent collaboration. Some students would work over the phone for hours, and others would gather at each other's houses to study and discuss the case late into the night. But aside from the student community that these late-night studies formed, Mrs. Gray formed a community of attorneys, judges, and teachers passionate about mock trial. Several months before the regional tournaments, Mrs. Gray would organize a scrimmage match between about a dozen teams, recruiting an army of volunteer judges. Moreover, Mrs. Gray's friendships with the best coaches in the state enabled her team to scrimmage against several advanced mock trial teams. But at the end of the year, whether or not our team won regionals, Mrs. Gray would hold her end-of-year award ceremony, praising by name every student's initiative, leadership, or growth. Teaching mock trial brought Sue Gray joy.

Caleb Woods is the CEO of RoleModel Software and is passionate about growing his employees in craftsmanship, character, and community. Craftsmanship at RoleModel begins with the "Academy" led by Caleb Woods. Every January, he hand-picks the applicants for that year's Academy. This year, Mr. Woods chose some remarkable people for the Academy. Although techies and programmers are known for their poor communication skills, these three "academites" (as we call them) presented their education and backgrounds to the company so well over Zoom, that one of them had the entire company laughing. Beyond selecting people for the academy, Mr. Woods takes time from being CEO to teach the Academy in the "RoleModel Way" (best practices) of programming. Beyond technical teaching, Mr. Woods often gives lectures at our weekly "Chow and Pow-wow" about character. For example, several months ago he taught a lecture on listening titled "Ask and Adjust." But more than teach character, he leads by example. For instance, a few weeks after his lecture on listening and asking for feedback, he finished a lecture on leadership by asking the whole company if there were any ways he could lead better. He wanted to hear how he could improve anytime — from anyone. Beyond incredible humility, Mr. Woods fostered a strong community. Every quarter, the whole company gathers in person for paid experimentation time, so that any employee can contribute to the company's direction. Additionally, Caleb Woods holds a paid company retreat every year where the main event is personal growth and fellowship. Caleb Woods found joy in cultivating the RoleModel Software community.

Caleb Woods is passionate about growing RoleModel Software into a thriving company. Every January, Mr. Woods carefully selects Academy applicants consistent with the company culture. For example, I was blown away by this year's applicants who, over Zoom, presented their education and backgrounds in a compelling manner. Furthermore, Mr. Woods personally trains these applicants in programming best practices and works through logical and technical challenges with them. When I was doing the Academy, Mr. Woods spent over an hour helping me fix an issue with my TCP sockets. Every week, Mr. Woods runs a company-wide meeting and lunch where people are encouraged to present interesting problems they've solved (like "The Case of the Uncreated Index"), explain something they've been learning about (like "The Science of Motivation"), and even propose tooling changes (such as Ben Einwecter's proposal to switch to the "Linear" project management system.) Every year, hosts a paid retreat where the main events are self-improvement, group fellowship, and the occasional game of frisbee. But most impressed me the most was the time Mr. Woods, after giving a lecture on leadership, asked the entire company for feedback on he could lead better. What's more, he truly wanted to hear what he could do better as he said "from anyone at any time."

%% What is the academy? %%

Caleb Woods, CEO of RoleModel Software, loves his company. 
Caleb Woods loves RoleModel Software. Every year, Mr. Woods carefully selects applicants for the RoleModel Academy. The Academy is designed to grow novice college graduates into "Craftsman" in about eight to ten years by giving them hands-on mentoring and experience in the universal principles of programming, not just one style or syntax. 

The Academy is not a typical programming class but is designed to teach the "RoleModel Way" of programming, where students get to learn.
The Academy is designed to put novice college graduates on the track to become "Senior Craftsman" in eight to ten years.

CEO Caleb Woods is passionate about growing RoleModel Software into a thriving company. Every year, Mr. Woods carefully selects applicants for the "Academy," RoleModel's apprenticeship program. Although techies and programmers are known for their poor communication skills, this year, Mr. Woods chose three academy students who presented their education and backgrounds over Zoom with ease and clarity — one even had the whole company laughing. However, the Academy isn't a regular programming course; it's designed to drill new programmers in the essential programming habits, setting them on track to become "Software Craftsmen" in about eight to ten years. In fact, Mr. Woods personally reviews the Academy students' code on a daily basis for the first week or so of the Academy. If a student forgot to test his code (one of those essential programming habits), their code would be immediately and irretrievably deleted. Mr. Woods not only leads hiring and teaching, but also leads business, design, development, and marketing with the same hands-on manner. For instance, Mr. Woods is the visionary behind much of RoleModel's marketing content, working closely with the marketing team — sometimes for hours. But more importantly, Mr. Woods has cultivated an incredible sense of teamwork and community. The RoleModel Slack workspace, for example, has a daily check-in channel where employees share what's on their mind. And these discussion topics can range from solar eclipses to music composition to golf. A recent check-in from Mr. Woods read:
	On My Mind:
	- Sun burn
	- Getting more consistent with golf shots
	- Why every time I hit a great shot yesterday, @Jamie Meeker (an employee) hit one just slightly better
Beyond this, Mr. Woods caters a meal at our weekly meeting, where people present what they're working on, things they've been learning about, or even propose tooling changes. No-one wants to miss these discussions. In fact, this weekly meeting usually starts with a weekly check-in where a rotation of employees are asked a series of questions. My favorite question is: "What would you do if you had nothing to do on a random Tuesday?" I could never guess some of the answers: gardening, running, legos, and reading the Divine Comedy. Many presentations and discussions are about personal development, such as Mark Kraemer's presentation on "The Science of Motivation." Once when we discussing optimal work schedules, John Calvin Young explained how he did some of his best work after 10pm at night. Mr. Woods even added that John's team sometimes moved their morning meetings later to accommodate him. After a discussion on leadership, Mr. Woods asked the entire company how he could lead better. Mr. Woods also sets aside billable hours for a yearly retreat, where employee's families are invited. The focus of these retreats is self-improvement and community fellowship, often including a game or two of frisbee.

CEO of RoleModel Software, Caleb Woods is passionate about leading RoleModel Software. Every year, Mr. Woods carefully selects applicants for the "RoleModel Academy" (our training program) based off three attributes: self-motivation, a desire to learn, and good communication skills. 

Aaron Jackson, Beth Grose, Sue Grey, and Caleb Woods found joy in their work in unique ways: Aaron Jackson lived his music; Beth Grose could talk about science for hours; Sue Gray loved building strong arguments and strong students; and Caleb Woods took time to train the new academites in the RoleModel Way. Regardless of how they did it, they found something good, true, and beautiful and pursued it with vigor. In the end, the overwhelming energy, fulfillment, and joy they found outweighed their initial effort and work. Furthermore, it overflowed into the people around them, creating communities of people with shared passion. I've always wanted to avoid work and live the "easy life." But the easy life isn't one filled with people or passion or joy. But now, instead of avoiding work, I'm searching for a work filled with goodness, truth, and beauty. I want to work with a passion that will overflow into the people around me. Let there be light indeed.
