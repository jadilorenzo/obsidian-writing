We had reached the final song of the "Let There Be Light" Christmas concert, and I sang the opening solo to a crowd of over two thousand people. Countless hours had been poured into crafting the concert, but no one invested more time and effort than the choir and orchestra director, Aaron Jackson. He led the choir and orchestra with precision, patience, persistence, and an exceptional sense of humor. What's more, Aaron Jackson brought an energetic joy that electrified the choir. If this energy had been condensed into a cup of coffee, it would have wakened a paralytic — "Let There Be Light" indeed.

Aaron Jackson had a strong sense of humor. Once he opened up his Campbell University joint choir practice with one of his favorite one-liners: "If it ain't Baroque, don't fix it.” During one Wednesday night practice, our youth choir was singing a song that involved singing the word "Hallelujah." To Aaron Jackson's dismay, we were singing the end of the word "Hallelu - yuh" like the word "yummy." He instructed us to sing it like "Hallelu - yaw" like a German saying "Yah, man" or, even better, like my name: "Yah - cob" ("Jacob" with a twist.) Even more than what he said, Aaron Jackson expressed humor through his facial expressions and the brightness of his eyes — like how he described the choir's proper expression: "From your nose down, your face should look like an opera singer; from your nose up, you should have the excitement of a first-grade teacher." Even when a choir member was difficult, his eyes shone — sometimes even brighter. One Wednesday, the youth choir warbled hideously out of tune, and upon hearing it, Aaron Jackson flung his music binder aside, flopped to the ground, and rolled around on the white, speckled linoleum floor — exclaiming, "Oh my stars..." in agony from hearing the painful disharmony.

Aaron Jackson had energy. Every Wednesday and Sunday, he blazed through hours and hours of practice with the adult choir, youth choir, chamber choir, and orchestra. Sometimes, he would be so excited about a musical piece he would ask the choir to repeat it out of sheer joy. In fact, he made the choir repeat the Hallelujah Chorus perfectly three times. When conducting, Aaron Jackson's entire body would take on the song's rhythm and timbre: he would bob up and down on his knees, his right arm would precisely meter out the time signature, and his face would become the expression of the music. If the song was bold and resounding, he performed wide and sweeping gestures and wore an expression of intense valor. Aaron Jackson was where he wanted to be.

Aaron Jackson taught music with precision. For instance, he taught the choir to have "tall" vowels. Choirs often have "flat" vowels and, consequently, a collective southern accent. Such flat vowels might turn "A mighty fortress is our God" into "I my dee fort dress is are God." As Aaron Jackson would remind us, "We're not a country town choir, you know.” These tall vowels are created by opening the space near the back of your jaw — similar to when you yawn. This space will change a tinny "me" into a resonant "may," and such resonance allows a listener to feel the vibration of the music, even from the back seat of an auditorium. Aaron Jackson also taught coordinated consonants. For instance, if consonants were disregarded, "immense and free," would easily become, "Immensss an free". Instead, Aaron Jackson taught leaving the consonant off till the next word so "s"s don't fizzle out or, worse, certain consonants disappear altogether. For example, we would sing "Immense and free," like "Immen san dfree," which may not sound great by itself but sounds great as a choir.

Aaron Jackson also taught musical self-evaluation. He would often ask the choir to identify their mistakes like an alto volunteering "I think the altos were a little off-pitch" or a tenor saying "The bass section was too quiet" (because they always were.)  On the Sunday after one Easter, the youth choir (about 15 members) was singing when the tenors came in off-tune. When Aaron Jackson later asked what went wrong, the lead tenor, the only youth who could truly sing the tenor part, took the mistake upon himself and admitted to leading the tenor section in singing the wrong note. These analyses taught me an ear for music. For example, before joining the youth choir, I had attempted to harmonize with little success, but now, I could harmonize with any hymn on the spot. Furthermore, I began to experiment on the piano, eventually sounding out my favorite song, "Faded." Aaron Jackson taught music with excellence.

Aaron Jackson achieved remarkable results. First, he built a talented musical community. For instance, the piano accompanist, Karen Bullock, could take any piece of sheet music play it perfectly first try. Out of the hours and hours she spent accompanying choir practice and performing, I've heard her only make one mistake. Then there's the Danchi family. All four kids played violin and viola professionally, and two sisters played in the orchestra weekly. Furthermore, so many people were drawn to Aaron Jackson and his music program that there were more than enough people for a full choir and orchestra to perform weekly. Second, Aaron Jackson conducted beautiful concerts. He spent months selecting music for the annual Christmas concert. Sometimes only a month after the Christmas performance, Aaron Jackson would roll out his selection for the next year. But when this performance finally came, it was a big deal. The auditorium, which could easily fit 1500 people, was packed. Seats were lined against the wall, and they too were filled. I was thankful the youth choir had reserved seating; otherwise, we might have had to stand. Aaron Jackson lived the music when he stood on the conductor's podium. His face took on a heavenly visage and his eyes glowed with inner light. The music was deep, rich, resounding, pure, lovely. On that very stage, it was as if Aaron Jackson wielded the full power of music: music that melted hearts and touched souls. Aaron Jackson's music was heavenly.

But was Aaron Jackson's energetic joy unique in my experience? No. Unlike many homeschool students, nearly all my teachers and mentors have been interesting and energetic. For a long time, I assumed these traits were dual eccentricities. But then I discovered that these people were the same in one vital way: they were energized by hard work that they loved.

%% Aaron Jackson's jet fuel was his love for music. %%

Beth Grose, for instance, loved teaching science. Every year she would play "The Periodic Table of Elements" song for the new batch of chemistry students. She would bouncing her head from side to side and sing along to "There's hydrogen and helium, then lithium, beryllium." She even had a song for Polyatomic Ions too. No one in their right mind could accuse Mrs. Grose of being boring! Even during her lectures, she would interrupt relevant course study to answer students' random questions such as "Why is hydrogen used in hydrogen bombs?" When it came time for the chemiluminescence lab, Mrs. Grose prepared everything. She got blackout blinds for the windows and moved all 25 students and 12 tables into one room. As soon as the reactants were mixed and all lights went off, Mrs. Grose would call out the time intervals — one minute, two minutes, three — and we would all write whether the chemicals in the glass vial were brighter than the minute before. We even measured whose reaction shone the brightest. Even after class, Mrs. Grose would talk about science-related topics — sometimes at great length. For example, she spent thirty minutes discussing screen radiation, citing studies showing phone-shaped tumors, and showing off her radiation-proof phone purse. Inspiring others to be passionate about science brought Beth Grose joy.
%% Mrs. Grose made labs something worth remembering. %%

Sue Gray was passionate about mock trial, having dedicated twenty years of her life to volunteer coaching. Mock trial is a simulated courtroom competition complete with attorneys, witnesses, affidavits, evidence, a judge, and a jury. The mock trial championship had three tiers: regional, state, and national. When the year's case was released, Mrs. Gray began to read the case with a furious intensity. Every week, she would quiz her students on their knowledge of the case. Every week, she would share discoveries she had made about the case. What's more, she would often perform example testimony in character: an expert witness would become a superlative academic and the best friend of the deceased would become a distraught college student. Whenever student attorneys practiced objection arguments, "Judge" Gray became an independent arbitrator and ruled in whichever way seemed to her most inconvenient to her students' case. Beyond class-time participation, Mrs. Gray expected a high level of independent collaboration. Some students would work over the phone for hours, and others would gather at each other's houses to study and discuss the case late into the night. But aside from the student community that these late-night studies formed, Mrs. Gray formed a community of attorneys, judges, and teachers passionate about mock trial. Several months before the regional tournaments, Mrs. Gray would organize a scrimmage match between about a dozen teams, recruiting an army of volunteer judges. Moreover, Mrs. Gray's friendships with the best coaches in the state enabled her team to scrimmage against several advanced mock trial teams. But at the end of the year, whether or not our team won regionals, Mrs. Gray would hold her end-of-year award ceremony, praising by name every student's initiative, leadership, or growth. Teaching mock trial brought Sue Gray joy.

Caleb Woods is passionate about leading RoleModel Software. Every year, Mr. Woods carefully selects applicants for the "RoleModel Academy" (our training program) based off three attributes: self-motivation, a desire to learn, and solid communication skills. Although programmers are known for their poor interpersonal skills, this year's Academy cohort presented their educations and backgrounds to the company with ease and clarity — one even had the whole company laughing. The Academy isn't a standard programming course either; it's designed to train new programmers in the essential programming habits (such as testing your code) so that in about eight to ten years, they can become "Software Craftsman" (the RoleModel equivalent of a senior developer). Mr. Woods personally leads the Academy, reviewing students' code daily for the first week or so of the Academy. If a student creates a feature without testing it first, all his new work is immediately and irrevocably deleted — the code equivalent of capital punishment. Ask me how I know. Mr. Woods is not only integrally involved in hiring and training, but is also deeply involved in design, development, and marketing. For example, Mr. Woods is the visionary behind much of RoleModel's marketing content, working closely with the marketing team for hours. But more important than business leadership, Mr. Woods cultivates teamwork and community at RoleModel. For example, our daily check-in Slack %%  %% has an "On My Mind" field, where countless fascinating conversations have been started. These conversations can range from solar eclipses to music composition to golf. One of Mr. Wood's recent posts reads: 
	On My Mind:
	- Sun burn
	- Getting more consistent with golf shots
	- Why every time I hit a great shot yesterday, @Jamie Meeker (an employee) hit one just slightly better
Employees also get to know each other over our weekly meeting where Mr. Woods caters a meal and people present what they're working on, things they've been learning about, or even propose tooling changes. No one wants to miss these discussions. This weekly meeting begins with a rotation of about four employees answering check-in questions such as "What's your highlight for the last month?" or "What books have you read recently?" My all-time favorite question is "What would you do if you had nothing to do on a random Tuesday?" Answers to this question always teach me something interesting about the person, whether they love gardening or would like to read Dante's *Inferno*. Many of these weekly presentations focus on personal development, such as Mark Kraemer's presentation on "The Science of Motivation." The following conversions are fascinating. Take our discussion on deep work, for instance, John Calvin Young explained how his best work often happens after 10 pm because no one is around. Mr. Woods added that John's team sometimes moved their morning meetings later to accommodate him. Mr. Woods loves optimizing — even if it's after 10 pm at night. For example, after a discussion on leadership, Mr. Woods asked the entire company how he could lead better as he said "from anyone at any time." Mr. Woods additionally hosts a paid yearly retreat, where employee's families are invited and the main focus is self-improvement and community fellowship, often including company-wide games of frisbee. 

Aaron Jackson, Beth Grose, Sue Grey, and Caleb Woods found joy in their work in unique ways: Aaron Jackson lived his music; Beth Grose could talk about science for hours; Sue Gray loved building strong arguments and strong students; and Caleb Woods took time to train the new academites in the RoleModel Way. Regardless of how they did it, they found something good, true, and beautiful and pursued it with vigor. In the end, the overwhelming energy, fulfillment, and joy they found outweighed their initial effort and work. Furthermore, it overflowed into the people around them, creating communities of people with shared passion. I've always wanted to avoid work and live the "easy life." But the easy life isn't one filled with people or passion or joy. But now, instead of avoiding work, I'm searching for a work filled with goodness, truth, and beauty. I want to work with a passion that will overflow into the people around me. Let there be light indeed.

Aaron Jackson, Beth Grose, Sue Grey, and Caleb Woods love their work: Aaron Jackson rolled around on the floor to make his point to the youth choir; Beth Gross interrupted important study time to answer my curious questions; Sue Grey volunteered twenty years of her life to mock trial coaching; and Caleb Woods takes time out his busy schedule to review Academy students' work. But whether these people intended it or not, they created communities of shared passion because they attract people to the work they love. Before taking Mrs. Grose's chemistry class, I never realized the beautiful balance of chemistry. Before participating in Sue Grey's mock trial team, I never saw the importance of eloquent argumentation. These people changed me; they revealed the beauty of what they found most beautiful.

But they also changed how I saw work. I had always thought that the best life was the "easy life." I thought work was a necessary evil to be dispensed with as soon as possible. But the easy life isn't one filled with people or passion or joy.
