- [ ] **TODO:** incorporate phone calls in the section about skiing with family

Pure white snow covers the mountain slopes. Colossal spires of rock reach the blue sky. Dark green evergreens dot the mountainside. Glades of lean, pale birch trees stand elegantly lit by the sun, and sheer gray cliffs jut out their aged faces to peer down on the quaint ski villages below. The thrill of adventure, the elegance of proper form, and the exhilaration of speed make skiing fantastic even for those who don't bask in the mountain's beauty.

People are the best part of skiing, so bring the people you love. I've skied with my immediate family, nieces and nephews, family friends, and even church groups. When we skied with groups from our church, my family would awake at 3:30 AM, drive an hour to carpool with our church friends and drive another three hours to the only “nearby” ski resort in Virginia. We would arrive at daybreak just as the resort opened. We were thrilled to be skiing in Virginia despite the inevitable icy snow, crowded lifts, and short runs. We zipped down the easy runs and gracelessly slid down the harder ones. After sundown, we caravanned toward home and stopped for dinner where we would talk for hours and hours. Even on trips with my family, I’ve come to see how people are more important than skiing. My older brother taught me how to snowboard, sacrificing a day to hold my hand and teach me to balance. When my younger brother, Matthew, switched from skiing to snowboarding, I helped him too. Skiing isn’t about the snow or the speed, it’s about building relationships.

Try meeting new people on the lift. I’ve met an Irish New Yorker who was an entrepreneur in finance, a reformed Baptist from Texas, a construction supplier on a business vacation, a retired Paralympian, and a member of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. You never know who you’ll meet! On one occasion, I was about to start a conversation when the eighty-year-old man sitting next to me on the lift spoke up. He told me about the special board he was trying out: an inch-thick wooden board, apparently designed to float on top of the snow instead of cut through it. He told me the precise amount of snow on the mountain. He told me his wife had decided to stay inside today but ski tomorrow. He gave me his opinion on which run the best snow. He told me all about himself. Not only have I met fascinating people, but I've learned about fascinating things: drinking laws in Utah, off-shore oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, rap albums, cybersecurity, and the origin of skiing as a sport. Lift rides are opportunities to meet people and learn new things.

Embark on unforgettable adventures with others. My younger brother, Matthew, and I once found a path that led straight into thick, dark woods. Instead of fearing the unknown, we plunged in and discovered our favorite run of the day. Even stressful experiences can be turned into adventures. On another occasion, Matthew and I were tasked with choosing which run to take down an unknown part of the mountain. We started down a trail that soon became steeper than we wanted. Off to the side of this trail, we saw a seemingly more moderate trail that led into the woods. We took the trail, hoping the wooded path would traverse the mountain to afford an easier descent. But it didn't. Now, my entire family was skiing along the top of a rounded bank that steeply plummeted onto the original path — no matter which way we turned. Worse, it was covered in moguls (large mounds of snow that make skiing more difficult). These moguls combined with the thick forest made the descent treacherous. One by one, each of us lost control and fell — our skis continuing the steep descent without us. After I reached the bottom, I sprawled out and laughed so hard that the lift operator asked if I was hurt. Unforgettable adventures like these turn challenging situations into treasured memories.

Embark on unforgettable adventures with others. For example, on another occasion, my family decided to try the back side of the Arapahoe Basin. Though the mountain was steeper and the snow was more icy, we figured we could handle it. At the top of the slope, we discovered it was steeper than we thought. There was no turning back. As we descended the steep slope, Matthew and I found a trail that led into the woods. We skied into it — hoping the wooded path would traverse the mountain to afford an easier descent. The rest of my family followed in blind faith. But the wooded trail didn’t traverse at all. It disappeared into hundreds of tiny paths pointing in every direction — especially downward. We were skiing along the top of a rounded bank that plummeted onto the original path no matter which way you turned. Worse, it was covered in moguls (large mounds of snow that make skiing more difficult). We did our best to descend slowly, but everyone lost at least one ski on the way down — except my older brother, the only snowboarder at the time. By fate, it was his job to collect all the runaway skis as we limped down the mountain. After we got into the open, I lay down and laughed so hard that the ski operator thought I was injured. If I feared difficulty getting down the mountain, I would have been petrified by the roughness of the snow, the slope of the descent, and the density of the trees. But instead, this adventure is a cherished memory. Challenges are inevitable like ice on a ski slope They aren’t obstacles; they are opportunities in disguise. 

Take skiing breaks with your group. Breaks are necessary so you can warm up, adjust your gear, and rest. But taking breaks with other people has its perks. First, you can eat together. No fries surpass those eaten on the mountain. No ribs taste better than those eaten in a ski lodge. Eating warm food when you’re tired, cold, and hungry is special because it satisfies you in so many ways. Second, no time is better to listen to a story than sitting by a fireplace, eating delicious food, and hanging out with friends. Our friend, Mr. Snyder, gets the award for the most dramatic and entertaining retelling of a skiing incident. He described how he took a seemingly regular lift, delighted by the lack of crowds or lines. Halfway up the several-minute ride, he began to wonder why the lift was so much longer and higher than the others. At the top, he observed the skull and cross bones sign that read “experts only” with a double black diamond sign below. He described the slope as a sheer cliff. He told how his legs had been rubberized. He claimed he never saw the black diamond warning signs till it was too late. Though the "rubberization" was obvious — he could barely walk, I doubted his claim of total unawareness; black diamond runs are always marked thoroughly. Lodge breaks make for fantastic stories and fantastic memories.

While having fun with your friends, don’t forget to record your trip. Though taking pictures may feel inconvenient at the moment, documenting your skiing adventure has multiple benefits. First, you could catch something really interesting on camera. One time when I was on a lift, I saw an eight-year-old do a backflip. My sister once recorded my older brother colliding with a friend. Second, you can see your skiing progress and improvement. For example, I helped my younger brother improve his snowboarding by recording how he prefers heel edge to toe edge. Third, a photo helps savor the scenery. The mountains are so majestic and beautiful that it’s hard to enjoy them properly. Their scale is almost impossible to comprehend. However, with a high-resolution photo, you can zoom in and out and fully enjoy the enormity of the landscape. Finally, recording your trip lets you enjoy your memories with more people. After every trip, I love visiting friends and family to look through all the photos and videos. Even non-skiers get to appreciate our favorite runs and the beautiful panoramic views.

Skiing is fantastic, but the best part of skiing is not the majestic scenery or the crazy stunts. Though these things are well worth enjoying, the relationships and memories from a great day on the mountain far outweigh the beauty and thrill of skiing. If you’re intentional about seeking and enjoying the best parts of skiing: relationships, adventures, and memories, you could end up finding the love of your life on the slopes — two of my siblings did.
