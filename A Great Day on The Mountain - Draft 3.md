Skiing is beautiful. Pure snow covers the mountain slopes. Colossal spires of rock on every side hem the blue sky into its vaulted dome. Dark green evergreens dot the white mountainside. Glades of lean, pale birch trees stand elegantly lit by the sun and its reflection in the snow, and sheer gray cliffs jut out their aged faces to peer down on the homely ski villages below. 

Even if one were to disregard the stunning scenery, the skiing experience is still breathtaking. The thrill of speed, the elegance of proper form, and the suspense of adventure make the skiing season one of the best. But eventually, the skiing season ends, the fun is forgotten, and the beautiful scenery fades in our memory. When you return home, what have you gained? Only the relationships you built and the adventures you shared truly last.

People are the best part of skiing, so bring the people you love. I’ve skied with a bunch of different people: church groups, family friends, nieces and nephews, and my immediate family. These day trips with my church group prioritized the relationship time, especially considering the logistical difficulties and the skiing conditions. My family would awake at 3:30 AM, drive an hour to carpool with our friends, and drive another three hours to the only “nearby” ski resort in Virginia. My favorite part was playing Catan on the iPad with my friends the _whole_ car ride. We would arrive just as the mountain opened. We were thrilled to be skiing regardless of the icy snow, crowded lifts, and short runs. We zipped down the easy runs and gracelessly slid down the harder ones. The experience of speeding down the slopes with droves of my friends rivals the camaraderie of a motorcycle gang riding through Las Vegas. After sundown, we would drive back together and stop at Cook Out for dinner. We sat and talked for hours and hours. Those were the best Cook Out milkshakes I’ve ever had to date. Even on trips with my family, I’ve come to see how people are more important than skiing. My older brother taught me how to snowboard, sacrificing a day to hold my hand and teach me to balance. When my younger brother, Matthew, switched from skiing to snowboarding, I helped him too. Skiing isn’t about the snow or the speed, it’s about building relationships.

Since your conversation isn’t confined to people you brought with you, try to meet people on the lift. I’ve met an Irish New Yorker who was an entrepreneur in finance, a reformed Baptist from Texas, a construction supplier on a business vacation, a retired Paralympian, and a member of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. You never know who you’ll meet! On one occasion, I was about to start a conversation with my fellow lift passengers when the eighty-year-old man sitting next to me on the lift spoke up. He told me about the special board he was trying out: an inch-thick wooden board, apparently designed to float on top of the snow instead of cut through it. He told me the precise amount of snow on the mountain. He told me his wife had decided to stay inside today but come out tomorrow. He told me which run, in his opinion, had the best snow. He told me all about himself. It was a joy to talk with him — I didn’t even introduce myself. Not only have I met fascinating people, but I've learned about fascinating things. I’ve learned about drinking laws in Utah, off-shore oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, cybersecurity, and the origin of skiing. One person even recommended a rap album. I love meeting people on the lift.

Embark on unforgettable adventures with others. 

Matthew and I once found a path that led straight into thick, dark woods. Instead of fearing the unknown, we plunged in and discovered our favorite run of the day. 
Even painful experiences can be turned into adventures. 

On one occasion, my younger brother and I were tasked with choosing which run to take down an unknown part of the mountain. We carefully started down the main trail, but it was steeper than we wanted. Off to the side of this trail, we saw a more moderate trail that led into the woods. We skied into it, hoping the wooded path would traverse the mountain to afford an easier descent. But it didn't. We were skiing along the top of a rounded bank that steeply plummeted onto the original path — no matter which way you turned. Worse, it was covered in moguls (large mounds of snow that make skiing more difficult). These moguls combined with the thick forest made the descent treacherous. One by one, we all lost control and came tumbling to a halt, one of our skis deciding to continue downhill without us. When we finally reached the bottom, though the descent was harrowing, the calamity of my whole family tumbling down a hill together had me laughing so hard that the lift operator wondered if I was hurt. If I feared the steep slope, this episode might have been the end of my skiing adventures, instead, it's a cherished memory. Challenges are inevitable, like steep places on a ski slope. They aren’t obstacles; they are opportunities in disguise.


Though we all lost control — even losing our skis, we managed to avoid slamming into any trees.

Coordinate skiing breaks with your group. Breaks are necessary so you can warm up, adjust your gear, and rest. But taking breaks with other people has its perks. First, you can eat together. No fries surpass those eaten on the mountain. No ribs taste better than those eaten in a ski lodge. Eating warm food when you’re tired, cold, and hungry is special because it satisfies you in so many ways. Second, no time is better to listen to a story than sitting by a fireplace, eating delicious food, and hanging out with friends. Our friend, Mr. Snyder, gets the award for the most dramatic and entertaining retelling of a skiing incident. He described how he took a seemingly regular lift, delighted by the lack of crowds or lines. Halfway up the several-minute ride, he began to wonder why the lift was so much longer and higher than the others. At the top, he observed the skull and cross bones sign that read “experts only” with a double black diamond sign below. He was in for some trouble. He described the slope as a sheer cliff. He told how his legs had been rubberized. He claimed he never saw the black diamond warning signs till it was too late. The rubberization was obvious — he could barely walk. However, his claim of unawareness was dubious. Firstly, Mr. Snyder is a confident, gregarious entrepreneur. Secondly, black diamond runs and lifts are marked thoroughly. Therefore, we surmised that his lack of awareness was feigned. A lodge break with your group can easily become the best part of your day on the mountain.

While you're having so much fun with your friends, don’t forget to record your trip. Though taking pictures may feel inconvenient at the moment, documenting your skiing adventure has multiple benefits. First, you could catch something really interesting on camera. One time when I was on a lift, I saw an eight-year-old do a backflip. My sister once recorded my older brother colliding with a friend. Second, you can see your skiing progress and improvement. For example, I helped my younger brother improve his snowboarding by recording how he prefers heel edge to toe edge. Third, a photo helps savor the scenery. The mountains are so majestic and beautiful that it’s hard to enjoy them properly. Their scale is almost impossible to comprehend. I love looking down the mountain and trying to find my car in the parking lot far below. Sometimes, the best I can do is find our hotel. However, with a high-resolution picture, you can zoom in and out and fully enjoy the enormity of the landscape. Finally, recording your trip lets you enjoy your memories with more people. After every trip, I love visiting friends and family to look through all the photos and videos. Even non-skiers get to appreciate our favorite runs and the beautiful panoramic views.

Skiing is fantastic, but the best parts of skiing are not what people often picture. They picture majestic scenery and crazy stunts. Though these things are well worth enjoying, the relationships and memories that come from a great day on the mountain far outweigh the beauty and thrill of skiing. If you’re intentional about seeking and enjoying the best parts of skiing: relationships, adventures, and memories, you could end up finding the love of your life on the slopes — two of my siblings did.
